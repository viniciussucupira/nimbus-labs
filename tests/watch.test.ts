/**
 * Lesson video: how long it was watched, what a plan covers of it, what is
 * charged past that, and what happens where there is nobody to charge
 * (lib/watch-rules.ts, lib/watch.ts, lib/watch-billing.ts, lib/learn.ts).
 *
 * Two services are somebody else's and are stood in for here. The video
 * service lists a store's videos with the seconds each has been watched, a
 * thousand to a page, the way its own "List Videos" page says. Stripe keeps
 * the lines added to a customer the way it does: one for each request, and
 * one only for requests that carry the same Idempotency-Key. Each can be
 * slow to the point of not answering, and Stripe can do the worse thing:
 * carry a request out and never say so.
 *
 * What no test here can hold is either service itself.
 *
 * Stripe's part was tried by hand in its sandbox on October 7, 2026, with
 * the very fields lib/billing.ts sends: the line was taken and tied to the
 * subscription, was found again by customer and date with its mark on it,
 * and stood on the preview of that subscription's next invoice beside the
 * plan; a subscription billed by the year took the setting that bills added
 * lines monthly. The charge itself is to be seen on a real invoice, the
 * first time a real store passes its hours.
 *
 * The video service's count was read against the live library the same
 * day: a lesson played once through, 24 seconds, came back as 24 seconds
 * more, and the five-minute job added exactly the service's total to the
 * store's month. The same reading showed where its player counts less than
 * was played (lib/watch.ts): replays in one sitting, after a video has
 * reached its end.
