/**
 * A partner's share of the product itself.
 *
 * What Hotmart files under its own "sales management and strategy" section and
 * calls Coprodução: somebody who helped make a product, or lent their audience
 * to its launch, takes a percentage of every sale of it — not only the sales
 * they personally referred. It is the difference between a partner and an
 * affiliate, and it is how a creator with no audience borrows one.
 *
 * Verified on Hotmart's own help centre on 4 October 2026, including the line
 * that decides this: "O coprodutor precisa ter uma conta Hotmart ativa para
 * receber um convite." Theirs only works between people already inside
 * Hotmart. Ours needs the partner to have no account anywhere — the creator
 * invites an email address, and the money is paid to a PayPal address. Stan
 * publishes only Affiliate Share, on its $99 plan; Kajabi publishes affiliates
 * from Growth at $199. Neither publishes anything that splits revenue with a
 * partner at all.
 *
 * And ours never divides a payment in flight, because the payment never
 * touches us: the share is recorded against each sale and paid by the creator
 * out of their own PayPal, in the batch they already send their affiliates.
 *
 * These hold the part a creator cannot be allowed to get wrong. A product has
 * one price, and everything promised on it — every partner, plus the affiliate
 * commission that rides on the same sale — comes out of that one price. Set
 * three shares carelessly and the product is sold at a loss, and the creator
 * finds out on an invoice. So it is capped, and the screen says what they keep
 * while they choose.
