/**
 * Waitlists: a product coming soon takes confirmed addresses, and the day it
 * goes on sale each gets one email.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Stan's "Product coming
 * soon!" only means no way to pay is connected; Whop's waitlist admits people
 * one by one and documents no email at launch. What is checked:
 *
 *   - only a product marked coming soon takes sign-ups;
 *   - an address counts once its owner presses the button in the email, and
 *     joins the creator's list only if they checked the box;
 *   - launching puts the product on sale, needs a postal address when anyone
 *     will be emailed, and emails each confirmed address exactly once, with
 *     the link, the price, the note, the address and a one-click way out;
 *   - whoever left is not emailed, and the addresses are gone afterwards.
