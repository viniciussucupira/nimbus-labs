/**
 * The buyer who stays with the affiliate who found them.
 *
 * Hotmart's affiliate settings offer a cookie that lasts "for ever". Nobody
 * can deliver that. Chrome caps the life of every cookie at 400 days from the
 * moment it is set and shortens a longer one without saying so, and long
 * before that the cookie is gone anyway because it lives in one browser:
 * cleared, or a new phone, or the work laptop, or a private window, and it
 * never existed. So "for ever" is 400 days at best, written down as something
 * else.
 *
 * What does last is not kept in a browser. Once a sale has been credited, the
 * creator may ask that the buyer stay with that affiliate — and then every
 * later purchase by that person earns them, on any device, at any distance.
 *
 * These hold the four things that make it safe to offer: it is off until a
 * creator asks for it, it never outranks a click, the buyer is stored as a
 * hash that cannot be read or lined up against another store's, and it cannot
 * grow into a cost.
