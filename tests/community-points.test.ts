/**
 * Points, levels, the leaderboard, and what a level opens.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Skool — 1 point a like,
 * 9 levels, a leaderboard, courses unlocked at a level; Circle — points,
 * levels, leaderboards, unlocked content; Mighty Networks — points, badges,
 * leaderboards; Stan — none. What is checked here is what members rely on:
 *
 *   - the levels are where the page says they are;
 *   - a point never goes below zero, and the creator never collects one;
 *   - the 7- and 30-day boards count only those days;
 *   - a course handed over at a level opens for that member, from the day
 *     they reached it, stays theirs if their points fall, and never opens
 *     for somebody the creator removed.
