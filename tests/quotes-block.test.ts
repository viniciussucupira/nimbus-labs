/**
 * Things said about a product elsewhere (lib/sales-page.ts, QuotesBlock;
 * components/sales-blocks.tsx). Each one is kept only with the https address
 * where it was said, and drawn with a link to it a visitor can follow and
 * check. Checked:
 *
 *   - which addresses are kept, written the way they will be linked, and
 *     which are not (another scheme, a login, this machine, too long);
 *   - a page sent with words but no working address is told back, not saved
 *     without them; one with neither is simply left out;
 *   - the words are never translated or rewritten: only the heading is;
 *   - drawn with who said it and a link to the original in the page's
 *     language, never as a review, and not a link in the studio's preview;
 *   - the coach counts it filled, and the gallery offers it.
