/**
 * Buyers taking their own affiliate link, where the creator lets them.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Stan's Affiliate Share
 * makes every customer an affiliate on its $99 plan; Skool lets members refer
 * on its $99 plan; Teachable has student referrals. Here it is a switch on
 * every plan. What is checked:
 *
 *   - the order is the proof: only a settled checkout of this store, read
 *     back from the creator's Stripe account, lets anybody in, and the
 *     address that paid is the one that joins;
 *   - it is off until the creator switches it on;
 *   - somebody the creator declined stays out, and somebody waiting for a
 *     decision is let in;
 *   - the creator cannot join their own programme this way;
 *   - the purchase email offers the link only where it works.
