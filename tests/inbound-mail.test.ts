/**
 * Mail written to the site's own addresses, sent on to the inbox that reads it.
 *
 * support@marktmorgen.com is printed across the site and had nothing behind
 * it: the domain sends through Resend and received nowhere. Resend now
 * receives for it, and announces each message to app/api/mail/inbound. What
 * is checked, with Resend played by a stand-in:
 *
 *   - nothing is received until the three settings are there, and the inbox
 *     may not be on the site's own domain;
 *   - an announcement without Resend's signature, or with an old one, is
 *     refused;
 *   - a signed one is fetched and sent on once: from the site's own address,
 *     with the writer's name, Reply-To the writer, the text, the page and the
 *     files, and a repeat of the same announcement sends nothing;
 *   - a file that is not on Resend's hosts, or that would pass the ceiling,
 *     is left out and named;
 *   - a message this file sent on itself is not sent on again;
 *   - when sending fails, the answer is a failure and the retry is heard;
 *   - an answer written to a store's own address on the creators' domain
 *     goes to that creator and nobody else, mail to a name that is no
 *     store's is dropped, and a store is sent on only so many an hour.
