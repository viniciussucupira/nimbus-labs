/**
 * A reply to a buyer's review, drafted with AI (lib/ai.ts, replyToReview;
 * components/review-studio.tsx). The model is played by a stand-in for
 * `fetch`. Checked: it is told the product, the stars and the buyer's own
 * words; told to write in the review's language, answer only what was said,
 * and for a low rating own it without promising anything; every honesty rule
 * is said; the draft is cut to what a reply may hold and counted as a job;
 * the route reads the review as it is kept, never as the browser sends it,
 * and only for a role that answers reviews.
