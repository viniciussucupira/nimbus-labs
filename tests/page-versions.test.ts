/**
 * Earlier versions of a sales page (lib/sales-page-store.ts, added
 * 8 October 2026). Kajabi, Hotmart Pages, Stan and Gumroad save a page over
 * itself: a save that went wrong cannot be taken back. What is checked:
 *
 *   - each save keeps the page as it was, newest first, five at most, and a
 *     save that changes nothing keeps nothing;
 *   - the list is forgotten 30 days after the last save, and with the product;
 *   - a version brought back keeps only the pictures the page still keeps,
 *     and says how many it lost, since a picture taken off a page is deleted.
