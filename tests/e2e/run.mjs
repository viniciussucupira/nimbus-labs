/**
 * The site itself, run on this computer and used in a real browser, from a
 * product's page to the email that opens what was bought.
 *
 *   npm run test:local
 *
 * Why it exists (7 October 2026). The unit tests call the code that hands a
 * purchase over; none of them goes through the door a buyer does. That is how
 * a paid gift went undelivered: every function it was made of was tested and
 * the path between them was not. And two things shipped that week — sections
 * on a store, and a purchase for several people — could only be looked at on
 * a store with products that can sell, which production does not have yet.
 *
 * What runs: the real app, built as the site builds it (`next build`, then
 * `next start`; E2E_DEV=1 runs `next dev` instead), unchanged, pointed at one local
 * stand-in for its database, for Stripe and for the email sender
 * (tests/e2e/services.mjs), through the addresses the code already accepts
 * for exactly this (STRIPE_CONNECT_API_BASE, RESEND_API_BASE, and the
 * database's own). No card is typed and no real service is reached. What it
 * cannot show is Stripe's own page: a checkout that is opened comes back
 * paid.
 *
 * What is checked, in a browser:
 *
 *   - the store page: its sections over the right products, and its line of
 *     news leading to a product;
 *   - a purchase for three people: the price times three, the link on the
 *     page after paying and in the receipt, three people each asking for a
 *     place and opening it from their own email, the product on each one's
 *     list of purchases, and a fourth person told every place is taken;
 *   - a gift: both emails, and the product on the recipient's list as a gift;
 *   - the studio: the sections as saved, a change to them showing on the
 *     store, and the sale named for what it was;
 *   - selling from the creator's own website: the code copied from the
 *     studio, pasted into a page on another address, shows the card; its
 *     button opens a paid checkout in a new tab with the place named on the
 *     sale; the plain button leads to the product's page; and the product's
 *     own page, framed the same way, is refused.
 *
 * It needs a browser driver (Playwright) on the machine; it is not part of
 * `npm test`, which runs anywhere. It takes about a minute.
 *
 * Checked against itself the day it was written: with the function that
 * finds a gift's product made to find nothing (the defect above), it stops
 * with a failure; put back, it passed four times in a row.
