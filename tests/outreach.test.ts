/**
 * Outreach: one email from a creator to a business, held to the law before a
 * word of it is written.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (5 October 2026): of the creator storefronts,
 * Beacons writes a pitch and nothing else, Stan has nothing; the tools that
 * do more (PitchBrand, Bento, SponsorRadar) are sold apart, from $29 a month.
 * Somebody else's website is played by a stand-in reader and the model by a
 * stand-in for `fetch`. What is checked:
 *
 *   - which countries may be written to, and under which conditions;
 *   - only an address at the business's own domain, printed on its own page;
 *   - a page that refuses proposals, a robots.txt that closes the site, and a
 *     business that asked to stop, each end it — the last by the business's
 *     own press, with nobody at the store doing anything;
 *   - the footer every email carries, and the draft link it travels in;
 *   - nothing here sends anything.
