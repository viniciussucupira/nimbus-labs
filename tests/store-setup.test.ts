/**
 * A store drafted with AI from a few sentences (lib/ai.ts writeStoreSetup,
 * lib/store-setup.ts; added 10 October 2026). Checked: the model is told to
 * work only from the creator's words and never to invent; what comes back is
 * held to its shapes; and what the creator keeps lands as drafts that are not
 * on sale, the line under the name, and the questions only where there were
 * none.
