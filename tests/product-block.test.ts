/**
 * Another product on a sales page (lib/sales-page.ts, ProductBlock;
 * lib/featured-cards.ts). Checked:
 *
 *   - a block keeps only a product id and a short line, nothing about the
 *     product itself, so what it shows is always today's;
 *   - the coach counts it filled only once a product is chosen;
 *   - cards come from the listings the store record carries, never the page's
 *     own product nor a draft, so drawing one costs no request;
 *   - the gallery offers it.
