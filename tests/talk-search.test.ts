/**
 * Searching the room and one's own messages.
 *
 * Circle searches messages with filters; Whop searches direct messages and
 * group chat. These close that gap — read straight from where the words are
 * kept rather than from an index, so nothing can fall out of step.
 *
 * The check that matters most is the last section: a person's search reads
 * their own conversations and nobody else's, whatever is typed.
