/**
 * A buyer's photo on their review (lib/review-photo.ts, lib/reviews.ts;
 * added 10 October 2026). Checked:
 *
 *   - only a JPEG or a WebP, by its own first bytes, of a sensible size and
 *     at most MAX_REVIEW_PHOTO_BYTES, is kept, in the store's own picture
 *     folder, under a name of its own;
 *   - a photo stays on its review through the buyer's edit;
 *   - putting a new one on gives back the one it displaced, and taking one
 *     off gives it back too, for deleting; the review itself stays;
 *   - deleting a product's reviews gives back their photos' paths;
 *   - a kept review with a photo that is not a store picture reads as none.
