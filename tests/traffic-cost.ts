/**
 * What a visit to a store costs us, worked out once for the two test files
 * that need it: tests/traffic.test.ts, which holds the counts below to what
 * the code really does, and tests/plan-margin.test.ts, which sets the sum
 * against what each plan brings in.
 *
 * The rates are the published ones, read on October 7, 2026, and they move
 * only when the vendors' do:
 *
 *   Vercel, CDN requests       $2.00 / million   (Flat Rate CDN, which this
 *                                                 account is on: each tier
 *                                                 is this much a million,
 *                                                 and the bytes sent are in
 *                                                 the tier, so a picture
 *                                                 costs a request and no
 *                                                 more whatever it weighs)
 *   Vercel, function calls     $0.60 / million
 *   Vercel, function CPU       $0.128 / hour
 *   Vercel, function memory    $0.0106 / GB-hour (2 GB for as long as a
 *                                                 request is being answered)
 *   Upstash, commands          $2.00 / million   (pay as you go, $0.20 a
 *                                                 hundred thousand)
 *
 * And what was measured on the live site that day. A store's front page,
 * opened for the first time: the page, 13 files of script and type that a
 * browser then keeps for a year, the count, the owner's photo and one
 * picture for each product drawn. The page took up to a second to answer
 * from the other side of the world.
 *
 * The visitor this is worked out for is heavier than visitors are: every one
 * of the 24 pictures a full page can hold is loaded, and two more pages are
 * opened after the first, each with pictures of its own. A visit is counted
 * once however many pages are opened (lib/traffic-rules.ts), so the pages
 * have to be in the cost of the one.
 *
 * What these figures count on, and what nothing here can check: that Flat
 * Rate CDN stays switched on in the host's billing settings. Without it the
 * bytes of every picture are charged by the gigabyte, and a visit can cost
 * thirty times this.
 *
 * One more rate, which Flat Rate CDN does not cover: what a function sends
 * the CDN ("Fast Origin Transfer", $0.06 a gigabyte in the region this runs
 * in). A page of a store is 44 KB as it travels, compressed, and 460 KB
 * before, measured on October 7, 2026; the host said on July 15, 2024 that
 * what travels between a function and the CDN is compressed, and the page is
 * costed as it travels, a little over. This is the figure to hold against
 * the host's own bill once real stores are visited: charged uncompressed, a
 * visit would cost a third more than is worked out here, which no plan's
 * price would fail to cover and every plan's margin would feel.
 *
 * And one more setting these figures count on, in the same place: that
 * Observability Plus stays switched off in the host's billing settings. It
 * was on by default (teams made on or after April 3, 2026 have it so) and
 * charged $1.20 for a million events, one for each call of a function and
 * more for what a function asks of the database: in the cycle to October
 * 7, 2026 it was 475,000 events against 137,000 calls. That is a tenth
 * more on a visit and nearly half as much again on a look at the live
 * room, in none of these sums. It was switched off that day; with it off
 * the host keeps a day of logs and charges nothing for them. The site
 * sends none of the host's Web Analytics or Speed Insights events, which
 * are charged by the event too.
 *
 * The same rates cost the two things a buyer's device does by itself: the
 * live room asking what is new (lib/chat-pace.ts), and a podcast app asking
 * for its feed (lib/podcast-access.ts). tests/room.test.ts and
 * tests/podcast.test.ts hold what each is counted as over what it costs.
