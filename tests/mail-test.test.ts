/**
 * Two subject lines for one email: who gets which, what decides it, and what
 * the studio is told about a decision that was not one.
 *
 * Read before it was built (6 October 2026): Kajabi picks a broadcast test's
 * winner by open or click rate, counted with a tracking pixel. This store
 * promises no pixel and no tracked link in an email (app/privacy), so the
 * winner here is the subject whose links brought more visits or sales, from
 * counts that never knew who anybody was.
