/**
 * The scroll animation may never be the reason a page is blank.
 *
 * Everything with `.reveal` on it starts at opacity 0, but only once a
 * script has written data-reveal="on" at the top of the body. For years the
 * thing that brought those sections back was a React effect, which does not
 * run until the bundle has downloaded, parsed and hydrated. Between the
 * first paint and that moment the visitor has a header and nothing under
 * it — and on a phone on mobile data that gap is seconds long, which is
 * exactly the "animations hiding content until the visitor scrolls" the
 * brief rules out.
 *
 * The fix is that the observer now starts in plain script at the end of the
 * body, so it runs as soon as the HTML is parsed. These checks hold the two
 * halves together: the hiding is never shipped without the showing, and the
 * showing is never moved back behind hydration.
