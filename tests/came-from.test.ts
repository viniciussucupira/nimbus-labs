/**
 * Which marketing channel the money came from.
 *
 * The store counted visitors by where they came from, and read the money
 * from the creator's own Stripe account, and never joined the two. A creator
 * could see that four hundred people arrived from a newsletter, and that
 * they made six hundred dollars, and not which of those four hundred were
 * the six hundred.
 *
 * The join costs nothing and records nobody: the tags the creator puts on
 * their own links are on the page the buyer presses the button from, the
 * browser sends that page as the Referer of the checkout, and the tags go
 * into the Stripe session's metadata — so they come back attached to the
 * payment, in the one record of money that deserves the name.
 *
 * These hold the two things that matter: that nothing but a tag is ever read
 * from that header, and that money in different currencies is never silently
 * added together.
