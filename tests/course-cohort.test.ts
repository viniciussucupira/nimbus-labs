/**
 * A cohort course: one clock for the whole room.
 *
 * Every course here ran to each student's own joining day — buy in March and
 * you are in week one in March; buy in July and you are in week one in July.
 * A cohort is the other kind: one date, set once, and everybody moves through
 * the weeks together from it.
 *
 * The whole difference is where the clock starts, so these check the clock
 * and nothing else. The cases that matter are the ones nobody would catch by
 * looking at a screen: a student who bought three weeks early must not be
 * able to open module one, and a student who joins late must not be made to
 * wait out the weeks again from their own joining day.
