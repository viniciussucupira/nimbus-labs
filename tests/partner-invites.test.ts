/**
 * A partnership offered to somebody who already has a store here.
 *
 * The first version of this was going to recognise the invited partner as a
 * creator of ours and write them straight into the programme — no email, no
 * link, done. That was wrong, and worth recording why: a share of every sale
 * is a commercial agreement, and creating it because we happen to know who
 * they are would be removing their consent to remove our friction. Knowing
 * somebody is a customer is a reason to ask them somewhere better. It is never
 * a reason to stop asking.
 *
 * So the agreement moves rather than disappearing: instead of a link in an
 * inbox, where things are lost, the offer waits in the studio they open on
 * purpose, with the share and the product names on the card they press. That
 * is a better record of agreement than an opened email, not a worse one.
 *
 * The reason this is worth building at all is quieter than the convenience.
 * Every partnership between two creators here ties both of them to the same
 * place through a relationship neither wants to break, and a hundred of those
 * is denser than a hundred separate stores. It is the one network effect
 * available without operating a public marketplace.
