/**
 * The store that costs more than it pays, and whether we hear about it.
 *
 * Delivery is the one cost with no ceiling anywhere in the code. The 200 GB
 * a month the subscription covers is counted and never enforced, on purpose:
 * somebody paid the creator for that file, and cutting their buyer off to
 * protect our margin would be taking money for a sale and then not
 * completing it. So the protection cannot be a door. It has to be knowing.
 *
 * And we did not know. The creator could see they were over, in their own
 * studio, while the first we would have heard of a store moving twenty-five
 * terabytes was the invoice — a month late and already paid.
 *
 * These hold the part that closes it: a store is written down the moment it
 * crosses, exactly once, and the number we read back is the real one.
 *
 * Since October 7, 2026 a file that is sold is kept where sending it costs
 * nothing (lib/vault.ts), so a download is no longer the cost with no
 * ceiling: lesson video is, and tests/watch.test.ts holds what is set
 * against that. What is left here is the knowing, which a storefront still
 * needs: a store far past what a plan covers in downloads is told so.
