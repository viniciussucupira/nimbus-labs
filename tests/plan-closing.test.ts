/**
 * A store whose plan has ended, and what it still keeps (lib/plan-closing.ts).
 *
 * A store with no plan may keep five gigabytes (lib/plan-standing.ts). One
 * whose plan ends may be keeping forty times that, put there while it paid,
 * and until this was written it kept it for ever at our cost. So what such a
 * store keeps past that room has a date on it: sixty days from the end of
 * the plan, said three times before it comes.
 *
 * This is the one thing here that deletes what a creator put here without
 * being asked to. What these hold, each against stand-ins for the file
 * store, the video service, Stripe and the email sender:
 *
 *   - a store that fits is never written to and never touched;
 *   - one that does not is written to when its plan ends, thirty days before
 *     the day and seven days before it, once each;
 *   - nothing is removed before the day, nor sooner than a week after the
 *     last notice went out, however late that was;
 *   - nothing is removed on our own note that the plan is over: Stripe is
 *     asked that day, and a plan it says is running is written back down;
 *   - nothing is removed, and nobody is told it was, when Stripe, the email
 *     sender or the file store could not be reached;
 *   - what is removed is the files and the videos, records first; the store,
 *     its products, its prices and its lessons stay;
 *   - a plan that ended, ran again and ended again starts from nothing.
 *
 * The host's own file store has no stand-in (its library does not ask
 * through `fetch`), so the stores here keep nothing in it, and its listing
 * is answered as empty.
