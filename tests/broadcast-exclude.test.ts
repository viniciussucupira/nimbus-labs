/**
 * Writing to the people who have not bought yet.
 *
 * A broadcast could go to everyone who agreed, or to the buyers of one
 * product. Not to the difference between them — which is the one letter in
 * this whole business that reliably sells: the people who took the free
 * guide and have not bought the course.
 *
 * It needed no new tracking. Every contact has carried `ids` from the
 * beginning, the products they asked for or bought, and the filter is one
 * line reading it. Nothing is now recorded about anybody that was not
 * recorded before, which is the only version of this feature worth having.
