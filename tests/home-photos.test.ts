 * Every photograph on the home page must be a real one.

 * Written after twenty of twenty-four ids shipped broken: they came from
 * Unsplash's search API, whose `urls.raw` needs query parameters this site
 * does not send, so the bare id resolved to nothing and the page served
 * twenty empty rectangles. The ids below were each loaded in a browser
 * before being written into the source.
 *
 * This test cannot reach the network — the sandbox has no route to the image
 * host — so it checks the two things that failed in practice: that every id
 * on the page is one that was checked by hand, and that no photograph is
 * used so often it stops reading as a market.
