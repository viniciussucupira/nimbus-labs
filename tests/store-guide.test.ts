/**
 * The store page's guide (lib/store-guide.ts, added 9 October 2026): a
 * visitor says what they want, and is shown which products fit, and why.
 * The model is played by a stand-in for `fetch`. Checked:
 *
 *   - off until answers are switched on, and with fewer than two products;
 *   - the model is told the catalog by number — titles, summaries, prices,
 *     what each is — and the creator's notes, never the products' ids, and
 *     drafts are left out;
 *   - its picks are held to the catalog: a number that is not a product, a
 *     repeat, a pick with no reason and links in a reason are dropped;
 *   - one pick is counted once; the same words are answered from memory;
 *   - "nothing fits" lands on the creator's list under the store page;
 *   - an answer in no shape that can be shown is never shown or filed;
 *   - an answer that did not come costs nothing; past the month's number it
 *     is closed and the model is not asked.
