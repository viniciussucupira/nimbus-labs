/**
 * The whole sales page, drafted by the writing help (lib/ai.ts, writePage) and
 * laid out as blocks (lib/sales-page.ts, blocksFromDraft).
 *
 * Measured before it was built (7 October 2026): Kajabi and SamCart draft
 * whole sales pages; Stan does not. The model is played by a stand-in for
 * `fetch`. What is checked:
 *
 *   - it drafts from what the product already says, with no notes needed,
 *     and refuses only when nothing at all was said about the product;
 *   - it is told never to write the creator's story or a guarantee it was
 *     not given, and a guarantee it returns anyway is dropped;
 *   - a price written into the button is taken out;
 *   - the draft becomes a page in the order that sells, held to every rule a
 *     page typed by hand is: one hero, first; one place for reviews; no
 *     "About you" block.
