/**
 * A file that is sold, kept in the store that charges nothing for a download
 * (lib/vault.ts): from the upload the studio opens to the address a buyer is
 * handed, and what happens when the studio says one thing and sends another.
 *
 * The store is somebody else's, so it is stood in for here by something that
 * speaks the same dialect (Amazon's S3): uploads in pieces, joined at the
 * end; a measure of each file; listing by folder, a page at a time. The
 * signatures themselves are held to Amazon's own worked examples in
 * tests/aws-sign.test.ts. What no test here can hold is the store itself:
 * that is for a real file in a real bucket, once there is one.
