/**
 * One refund window, everywhere, and never a number typed out by hand.
 *
 * The window was fourteen days and is now thirty. It is stated on the home
 * page twice, in both plan cards, in the help center, on the mission page,
 * in the Terms and all through the Refund Policy — and it is also the
 * reason INVITE_HOLD_DAYS is what it is, because credit must not be paid to
 * an inviter on a payment that can still be handed back. That is eight
 * places to change and one of them is not a sentence at all.
 *
 * Advertising a longer window than the policy honors is a false promise;
 * holding invite credit for less than the window pays out money we may have
 * to return. Both are silent failures. These checks make them loud.
