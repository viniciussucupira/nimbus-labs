/**
 * The tax number box and the invoice: what a checkout carries when a creator
 * switches them on, and that neither is ever the reason a checkout fails to
 * open.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (6 October 2026): Gumroad takes a business
 * buyer's VAT number at checkout and has an invoice generator; Teachable
 * takes a VAT ID at checkout; Stan's help center names neither. Here both are
 * Stripe's own, on the creator's account, so the creator stays the seller.
