/**
 * The live room: how often it asks, who may ask, and what the asking is
 * counted as (lib/chat-pace.ts, lib/chat-pass.ts, lib/chat-grant.ts).
 *
 * The room used to ask a route that read the store, the member and the
 * room every four seconds for as long as its tab was in front, and nothing
 * was set against what that cost. What is held here:
 *
 *   - the pace follows the room and the reader, and stops when nobody is
 *     there;
 *   - what is asked every few seconds is one read, opened by a pass, that
 *     the CDN may answer for everybody at once;
 *   - a pass opens a room for the ten minutes it was made in and the ten
 *     after, and no other room;
 *   - each ten minutes of asking is counted toward the store's visits once
 *     for a member, at what it can cost at the most, never for the creator,
 *     and a store with no plan to charge is given none past its visits;
 *   - what it is counted as is more than it costs.
