/**
 * The studio's help assistant (lib/help-ask.ts, lib/ai.ts answerHelp; added
 * 10 October 2026). Checked: a question finds the help center's answers it is
 * about, by their words, whatever their form; a question about nothing finds
 * none; the model is given those answers only and told to add nothing; and
 * the sources it names are the help center's own anchors.
