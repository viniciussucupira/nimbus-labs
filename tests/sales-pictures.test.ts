/**
 * Pictures, a countdown and templates on a sales page (lib/sales-page.ts,
 * added 7 October 2026).
 *
 * Measured that day: Kajabi and Hotmart Pages have image sections, a
 * countdown and a gallery of templates; theirs can count down "evergreen",
 * starting again for every visitor. What is checked:
 *
 *   - a picture is only a file in a picture folder, with its size; each is
 *     shown once, a block holds six and a page twenty-four, and a page sent
 *     with one that was not kept is refused, said as such;
 *   - a countdown is one moment, the same for everybody: it needs one, not
 *     more than a year away; a moment that has passed is kept but not live;
 *   - a template is an order of blocks under the product's own title, and
 *     writes no sentence about the product;
 *   - a picture belongs to the one page that first showed it: another page
 *     cannot take it, and only its own page's leaving it deletes the file.
