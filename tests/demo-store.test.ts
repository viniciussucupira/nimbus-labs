/**
 * The demo store is a store.
 *
 * "Live demo store" was a page written by hand: it shared no code with a
 * creator's store, so what a visitor tried there was not what a creator's
 * buyers get. It is now made by lib/demo-seed.ts with the functions the
 * studio's own routes call, and drawn, sold and handed over by the pages and
 * the checkout every store runs on. What is checked here, by running it:
 *
 *   - made once, it is a store that can sell: its address, its product with
 *     two prices, a file behind each in the store's own folder, its picture
 *     and photo, its long description;
 *   - asked again it reads one mark and writes nothing; after a deployment
 *     that changes the code it is brought in line without fetching anything
 *     it already has; a photograph that could not be fetched is named, left
 *     alone for a while and then tried again;
 *   - its checkout is the real one, signed with the demo's own test key on
 *     the demo's own account — also on the day our own key is a live one —
 *     and carries the store's name, which a refusal never costs the checkout;
 *   - the few ways it is not like other stores (lib/house-store.ts): nobody
 *     can sign in as its owner, it takes no reviews, it writes to no buyer,
 *     and its pages say it is a demo;
 *   - nothing of the hand-written demo is left, /demo leads to the store,
 *     and every form that opens a payment page leaves the frame the home
 *     page shows the store in.
