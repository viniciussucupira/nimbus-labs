/**
 * The writing help: what is asked of the model, what is read back, and what
 * a store pays for it out of its month.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Circle, Mighty Networks,
 * Kajabi, Teachable, Thinkific and Beacons all write for a creator; Stan's
 * Stanley answers questions about Stan. The model is played by a stand-in for
 * `fetch`. What is checked:
 *
 *   - no key, no writing help, and nothing counted;
 *   - every request carries the rules against invented reviews, numbers,
 *     results and urgency;
 *   - only what fits the studio's boxes comes back, cut to their limits;
 *   - a job that fails is not counted, and a month's allowance is a ceiling;
 *   - an outline goes into a course whole, or not at all when it would not fit.
