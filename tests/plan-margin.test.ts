/**
 * No plan may lose money in its own worst case.
 *
 * Every brake in this system was set on its own, against the question "would
 * a real creator ever reach this?" — and every one of them passed that
 * question. Then the worst cases were added up for the first time and both
 * plans lost money: the $29 one by $31 and the $99 one by $15. A brake is
 * not a brake if the sum of all of them sits above the revenue they protect,
 * and no individual check would ever have noticed, because each number was
 * defensible alone.
 *
 * So the sum is the thing that is checked. These are the real published
 * rates, and they move only when the vendors' do:

 *                                                     kept until October 7,

 *   Stripe                     2.9% + $0.30 on each subscription charge
 *
 * What changed on October 7, 2026, and what these figures now count on.
 *
 * A download used to cost five to eleven cents a gigabyte, and the brake on
 * free copies was the dearest line a $29 store had. A sold file now goes to
 * the store that charges nothing to send it, and the door to the dearer one
 * is shut wherever that store is set up and on the paid site always
 * (app/api/store/file), so a missing setting stops an upload instead of
 * bringing the cost back. No plan had been sold before that day, so no
 * paying store has a file in the dearer one. Keeping a file is still worked
 * out at the dearest of the three rates.
 *
 * Which left two things that cost by use. One is visits: every page of a
 * store that is opened is charged for by the host, by the file, by the
 * call and by the command sent to the database, and that was in none of
 * these sums until October 7, 2026, when a hundred thousand visits in a
 * month were found to cost more than the smallest plan had left. A visit is
 * now counted, covered up to a figure by each plan and priced past it
 * (lib/traffic-rules.ts), and what one costs is worked out in
 * tests/traffic-cost.ts from what the live site was measured to do. It
 * counts on one setting nothing here can see: Flat Rate CDN, in the host's
 * billing, which puts the bytes sent inside a fixed tier. It was on when
 * this was written.
 *
 * The other is lesson video, and it is
 * covered and priced by the hour watched (lib/watch-rules.ts). Its worst
 * case is here twice: the hours a plan covers have to fit inside the plan
 * with every other brake at its limit, and an hour past them has to bring in
 * well over what it costs. An hour is costed at the largest size kept, with
 * a quarter added for what a player fetches ahead of what is watched: 6.9
 * megabits for every second counted.
 *
 * Against that, the one clean measure there is. On the live library, on
 * October 7, 2026, a 1080p lesson played once through was counted as 24
 * seconds and took 12.3 megabytes from the video service: a little over 4
 * megabits a second, so the figure above has more than half again over it.
 * The player was also seen to count less than it sent, in a sitting that
 * replayed a video after it had ended (lib/watch.ts); that headroom is what
 * has to carry
 * such sittings, and an hour past the plan goes on paying for itself up to
 * 13.9 megabits for every second counted. These are the two numbers to
 * hold against the video service's own bill once real stores are watching.
