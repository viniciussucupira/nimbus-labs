/**
 * A share for one affiliate, and the PayPal address they choose.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Stan lets a creator edit
 * one affiliate's commission (help.stan.store, article 378), and its
 * affiliates connect their own Stripe or PayPal to be paid (article 402).
 * What is checked:
 *
 *   - a share set for one affiliate replaces the program's and each
 *     product's, except on a product taken out at 0%, and reaches the sale,
 *     the add-on and the approval email; cleared, the program's shares return;
 *   - out-of-range shares are refused;
 *   - an affiliate's own PayPal address is where PayPal pays them, in the API
 *     batch and in the uploaded file; the address they joined with hears of
 *     every change; a bad address changes nothing.
