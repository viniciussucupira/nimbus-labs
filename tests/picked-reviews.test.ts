/**
 * Reviews the creator picks to show first (lib/sales-page.ts, ReviewsBlock;
 * lib/reviews.ts, visibleReviews; added 8 October 2026). Kajabi and Hotmart
 * let a creator type testimonials, which nobody can tell from real ones; here
 * a creator can only choose among reviews buyers who paid wrote. Checked:
 *
 *   - a page keeps up to three picks, each a review id, once;
 *   - the picked ones come first, in the creator's order, then the newest,
 *     read in the same request, and the page still holds as many as before;
 *   - a hidden or refunded review is never put first, and a pick that no
 *     longer exists is passed over;
 *   - the review is marked as picked in every language a store can be in.
