/**
 * A visitor's question about a product, answered from what its page says
 * (lib/answers.ts, added 7 October 2026).
 *
 * Measured that day: Kajabi sells an agent that answers pre-purchase
 * questions for $79 a month each. The model is played by a stand-in for
 * `fetch`, which also records what it was sent. What is checked:
 *
 *   - off until the creator switches it on;
 *   - what the model is told is the page — price, delivery, description,
 *     the page's own questions, the creator's refund promise and notes — and
 *     the question, and nothing else;
 *   - it is asked of the smallest model, briefly;
 *   - an answer is counted once; the same question about the same page is
 *     answered from memory and costs nothing; a changed page is read again;
 *   - what the page does not say is said plainly, and the question is kept
 *     for the creator with the product and nothing about who asked;
 *   - an answer that did not come costs the store nothing; one that came in
 *     no shape that can be shown (what an attempt to give the model orders
 *     gets) is never shown, and is not put on the creator's list;
 *   - past the month's number the box is closed and the model is not asked.
