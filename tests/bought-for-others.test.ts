/**
 * A gift and a purchase for several people, through the door every paid
 * checkout goes through (lib/purchase-email.ts confirmPurchase).
 *
 * Found on 7 October 2026, while building purchases for several people: a
 * paid gift was never handed over. The confirmation looked for the gift's
 * product in the list of what the checkout hands to whoever paid — which for
 * a gift is nothing, by design — found none, and stopped. The buyer was
 * charged and told "we are emailing them now"; nobody was emailed. The tests
 * of gifts called the delivery itself and never this door. What is checked:
 *
 *   - a paid gift, confirmed: the recipient has it and both emails went;
 *   - a paid purchase for several, confirmed: its link works and the buyer's
 *     receipt went;
 *   - either one confirmed again does nothing more;
 *   - the creator can send the buyer of several places their link again;
 *   - an unpaid one is left alone.
