/**
 * The brake on storage, and the two things it must never do.
 *
 * Storage was the one cost with no measurement of any kind. Nothing bounded
 * what a store could hold except 2,000 products times a 5 GB file — ten
 * terabytes, about $230 a month, for ever, from a creator paying $29,
 * whether or not they ever sold anything.
 *
 * What it must never do is show up as a plan limit. Stan publishes no
 * storage limit, no file-count limit and no bandwidth limit; their only
 * published figure is 5 GB a file, which is also ours. A quota on our
 * pricing page would lose us a line to them to guard against a number no
 * honest creator reaches. So it is one high figure, the same on every plan,
 * and it lives nowhere a plan is chosen.
 *
 * And it must never reach a buyer. It is checked when a creator uploads,
 * which is the one moment where saying no costs nobody anything.
