/**
 * "What buyers say" on the store page (lib/store-quotes.ts, added 9 October
 * 2026): the newest reviews with words, kept on the store's record. Checked:
 *
 *   - the newest first, at most three, each with its product's title;
 *   - never a hidden review, never a refunded one, never one with too few words;
 *   - nothing chosen by its stars: a newer three-star review comes before an
 *     older five-star one;
 *   - kept again after a change, and long words cut at a word.
