/**
 * Comments under lessons: who sees what, what is kept, and who is told.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Kajabi, Teachable and
 * Thinkific let students comment under a lesson; a course sold on Stan is a
 * list of lessons with nowhere to ask a question. What is checked:
 *
 *   - a student chooses a name once, and it is shown instead of their address;
 *   - answers are one level deep, under a comment of the same lesson;
 *   - a hidden comment is seen only by the creator and whoever wrote it;
 *   - deleting a comment takes its answers, and deleting a lesson its comments;
 *   - the studio counts what is new since it last looked;
 *   - a student is emailed when the creator answers them, not when another
 *     student does, and not twice in an hour for one lesson.
