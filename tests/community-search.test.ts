/**
 * Searching past the posts: lessons, events and people.
 *
 * A community that could only find posts was behind three of the four rival
 * platforms that document a search at all (checked 30 September 2026). Widening
 * it means the index now holds things that are not all readable by everybody,
 * which is the part worth checking hardest: a lesson title is content, and a
 * search that hands one to somebody who never bought the course has given the
 * course away down the side of a text box.
 *
 * So these run the real index against the real store double, and then check the
 * shape of the thing the page hangs its gate on.
