/**
 * Everything a thumb has to find is at least 44 pixels tall.
 *
 * This was measured, not assumed. Every page was loaded at 375 points wide —
 * the narrowest phone still in use — and every link, button, summary, input
 * and select on it was asked for its real height. The answers were not close
 * to 44: pills and tabs at 40, a "Reply" disclosure at 24, the quiet text
 * links the whole community runs on at 18, a store footer's links at 36, the
 * logo at 40.
 *
 * Nearly all of it turned out to be eight rules in app/globals.css rather than
 * two hundred places in the markup, which is the way a design system is
 * supposed to fail: once, where it is defined. So the floor is checked there.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does not require.
 *
 * A link inside a sentence keeps the line's own height. WCAG exempts it, and
 * it is right to: a 44px box around three words in the middle of a paragraph
 * tears the paragraph apart. "By continuing you agree to the Terms" is one
 * sentence, and the link in it is text, not a control.
 *
 * A badge is not a button. A row of status pills reading "Card", "PayPal",
 * "Apple Pay" is type, and type set 44px tall to satisfy a rule about fingers
 * is simply wrong-looking. Those keep their own height, and say in a comment
 * beside them that they are not pressed.
