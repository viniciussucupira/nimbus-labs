/**
 * A sales page's picture described for someone who cannot see it (lib/ai.ts,
 * describePicture). The model is played by a stand-in for `fetch`. Checked:
 * the picture goes as an image of its own type with the product's name; the
 * store's language and the rules (only what is seen, no names or results)
 * are said; the answer comes back as one clean line no longer than a
 * description may be, counted as a month's job; a picture too large is
 * refused before the model is asked. The studio only sends a picture from
 * the store's own folder.
