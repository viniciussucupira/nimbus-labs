/**
 * Not open yet.
 *
 * Marktmorgen is still being built (5 October 2026), and the site was taking
 * a card for a 14-day trial as if it were finished. One constant now says
 * whether a plan can be started (lib/opening.ts). While it cannot:
 *
 *   - the checkout that starts a plan refuses, without asking Stripe for
 *     anything, and a store is left exactly as it was;
 *   - the studio shows the reason where the buttons were;
 *   - every public page says so at its top, and no button promises free days
 *     that cannot be started;
 *   - the mission page counts starting a plan as not built.
 *
 * Written against the constant, so the day it is changed to `true` this
 * file checks the other half instead of failing.
