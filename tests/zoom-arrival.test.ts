/**
 * Arriving for Zoom, and checking that a connection works.
 *
 * Zoom's reviewer opened the Video calls page (1 October 2026) and found no
 * place to authorize Zoom. The listing's link offers Zoom on the visit that
 * carries its word — but somebody who opens it without being logged in is
 * sent to log in and make a store first, and the word is gone by the time
 * they are back. And once connected, nothing on the page showed that a
 * meeting is really made until a buyer booked a call. Zoom is played by a
 * stand-in for `fetch`. What is checked:
 *
 *   - opening the link sets a cookie that says only "came for Zoom", on that
 *     page and with those words alone;
 *   - a browser that carries it is offered Zoom's form with no word in the
 *     address, and one that does not is still refused;
 *   - a test meeting is made on the connected account with the same call a
 *     booking's is, one at a time, and deleted there when asked;
 *   - it is forgotten with the connection, and a provider that fails says so.
