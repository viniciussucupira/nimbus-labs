/**
 * Pictures in a creator's email (lib/mail-picture-rules.ts,
 * lib/mail-pictures.ts, lib/mail.ts bodyHtml; added 10 October 2026). Checked:
 *
 *   - only a line of its own naming a JPEG kept on this site becomes a
 *     picture; one from anywhere else, a WebP, or a line with words around
 *     it stays text;
 *   - the description is made safe, and shown to readers without pictures;
 *   - an email shows six at most; the rest stay text;
 *   - only a JPEG of a sensible size and weight is kept.
