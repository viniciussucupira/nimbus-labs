/**
 * A store with a bad list is stopped by itself, before it costs every other
 * store its email (lib/mail-health.ts).
 *
 * Every store sends through one account at the sender, which judges the
 * account as a whole: past 4% bounced or 0.08% marked as spam it "may be shut
 * down without warning" (resend.com/legal/acceptable-use, read October 6,
 * 2026), and that account also sends every login link. These check that an
 * address the sender gives up on is never written to again, that a store is
 * paused inside those lines and not for a handful of typos, that nothing
 * waiting is lost, and that it all goes on again without anybody pressing
 * anything.
