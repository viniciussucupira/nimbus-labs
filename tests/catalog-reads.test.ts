/**
 * How many Redis commands it costs to draw a page.
 *
 * Upstash bills by the command, not by the round trip. So a screen that reads
 * every product in the store to build a list of names costs one command per
 * product, every time it is opened — and a creator at the 2,000-product
 * ceiling was spending two thousand commands to open the email page. Per view.
 * Per creator. With no ceiling of its own.
 *
 * That is the cost-without-a-limit this product is built not to have, and it
 * was not hypothetical: nine call sites did it, across the studio and the
 * public API, and the comment above one of them already said "thousand records
 * to answer one price change" — somebody had seen it and not had a way out.
 *
 * The way out was that the store's own index already answers nearly all of it.
 * It carries, for every product, what kind of thing it is — paid or free, a
 * call, a course, a membership, limited, hidden, has a funnel, is a bundle —
 * and the ids of its price options, all inside the store record that every
 * page reads anyway. What it did not carry was the name, the price and
 * whether the product has a sales page, which is what the lists actually want.
 * Those three now live in one hash: HSET beside the product under the lock the
 * store already holds, one HGETALL to read all of them.
 *
 * These hold the shape, because the easy thing to write is the expensive one.
