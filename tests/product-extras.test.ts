/**
 * What stops being shown when a creator changes a different product.
 *
 * The defect these were written for: lowering one product's price silently
 * killed every checkout box and after-paying offer that charged more for it
 * than it now cost, and raising a price silently killed the payment plan that
 * used to cover it. None of that was wrong — a box dearer than the product is
 * not a box to show — but the studio went on saying "Offers Templates for $9 at
 * checkout" and "Payment plan: 3 monthly payments of $110" through all of it.
 * The only way to find out was to notice the money missing.
 *
 * So what is checked here is that the rule and the reason cannot drift apart:
 * `activeBump` and `bumpState` are one set of rules, and every way an extra can
 * go quiet has a sentence naming the product to change.
