/**
 * Welcoming a new member: the creator's questions and the welcome message.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Skool asks up to three
 * membership questions on every plan and sends an automatic welcome DM on
 * its $99 plan; Whop sends automatic welcome messages; Circle and Mighty
 * Networks welcome through workflows and AI agents. Here both are on the $29
 * plan. What is checked:
 *
 *   - answers count only when every question asked has one;
 *   - a question reworded later never sits over an old answer: each answer
 *     keeps the question it answered;
 *   - the welcome is sent once, from the creator, and never while private
 *     messages are off.
