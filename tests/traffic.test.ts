/**
 * Visits to a store, counted and set against its plan
 * (lib/traffic-rules.ts, lib/traffic.ts, lib/traffic-billing.ts).
 *
 * Every page of a store that is opened costs us a little, and until this
 * was written nothing was set against it: a store on the smallest plan
 * could be sent a hundred thousand visits in a month, and a store with no
 * plan any number, both at our cost.
 *
 * What these hold, against stand-ins for Stripe and the email sender:
 *
 *   - a visit is one address on one day for one store, whatever it opens,
 *     and a new-style address is counted by its network;
 *   - the store's owner and a robot are never counted;
 *   - a store that pays is never rested, and is not even asked about;
 *   - a store with no plan to charge rests at the visits it has, and what
 *     its buyers have stays outside that;
 *   - visits past a plan's are put on the next invoice once, by the plan
 *     the store is on, and never twice;
 *   - a page sends the database no more commands than the cost of a visit
 *     is worked out with (tests/traffic-cost.ts).
