/**
 * What a sale through an affiliate's link earns.
 *
 * This file exists because of one defect that reading the code did not show.
 * `attributionFor` threw the credit away when the *front* product earned 0%,
 * before anything else in the order was looked at. A creator who pays nothing
 * on a $7 front offer and 30% on the $97 add-on — an ordinary arrangement, and
 * the whole reason per-product rates exist — had every one of those sales
 * credited to nobody. The share was already carried correctly in the charge's
 * own record; it simply never got written, because the decision was made in
 * the wrong place.
 *
 * So the checks here are about *where* the decision is made: the click is read
 * on its own, the order's earnings are worked out from the whole order, and the
 * two are not allowed to collapse into each other again.
