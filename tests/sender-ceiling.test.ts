/**
 * List email is held back before the sender's own ceiling stops everything.
 *
 * The sender pauses a whole account at five times its plan's monthly emails
 * (resend.com/docs/knowledge-base/account-quotas-and-limits, read October 6,
 * 2026). The whole account is every creator's newsletter and also every
 * login link and every email that hands a buyer their file. So list email
 * waits at four fifths of that ceiling, and the rest is kept for the emails a
 * store cannot run without. These check that it waits, loses nothing, tells
 * the owner once, and goes on by itself.
