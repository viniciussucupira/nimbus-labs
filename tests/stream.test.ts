/**
 * A lesson's video kept by the video service (lib/stream.ts): from the door
 * the studio asks for to the player a student is shown, and everything that
 * can go wrong between.
 *
 * The service is somebody else's, so it is stood in for here, faithfully
 * enough to be slow, to fail, to be unreachable and to announce things: the
 * numbers it gives a video are its own (its API's VideoModelStatus), and the
 * two signatures are worked out the way its own pages say. What no test here
 * can hold is the service itself; that is for a real video in a real
 * library, once there is one.
