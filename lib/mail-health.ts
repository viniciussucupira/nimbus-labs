/**
 * A store's email to people is stopped by itself when its addresses turn out
 * to be bad ones, before they can cost every other store its email.
 *
 * Every store here sends through one account at the sender, and the sender
 * judges the account as a whole: more than 4% of its email bouncing, or more
 * than 0.08% of it marked as spam, and the account "may be shut down without
 * warning" (resend.com/legal/acceptable-use, read October 6, 2026). Its own
 * guide to accounts shared by many customers says the same thing from the
 * other side: one of them writing to a stale list can take the others down
 * with it. The account is also what sends every login link and hands every
 * buyer their file.
 *
 * A creator does not have to mean any harm for this to happen. A list
 * exported from another platform three years ago is full of addresses that
 * no longer exist, and importing it and writing to it is exactly what this
 * store invites them to do.
 *
 * So two things happen by themselves, and neither needs anybody watching:
 *
 *   1. An address that bounces for good, or whose owner marks the email as
 *      spam, is never written to by that store again (lib/contacts.ts,
 *      stopWriting). The sender tells us about each one
 *      (app/api/mail/inbound), and says which store it was by the tags these
 *      emails carry.
 *
 *   2. A store whose last seven days show too many of either is paused for
 *      seven days. Its list emails wait, as they do when a month runs out,
 *      and go on by themselves afterwards, to a list the bad addresses have
 *      by then been taken off.
 *
 * Two kinds of email are watched, because they are the two that go to
 * addresses somebody typed or brought in a file rather than ones a payment
 * proved: a creator's email to their list (lib/mail.ts, sendTo), and the one
 * email to buyers brought over from another platform (lib/imports.ts). A
 * sign-in link, a receipt, or an announcement to paying members is neither
 * counted nor paused.
 *
 * The lines are drawn inside the sender's own, so a store is stopped before
 * the account is in question:
 *
 *   bounces      at least 25 of them, and 2% or more of what was sent
 *                (the sender's line is 4%)
 *   complaints   at least 5 of them, and 0.08% or more of what was sent
 *                (the sender's own line: a store is not held to a stricter
 *                one than the account, only to the same one sooner)
 *
 * The floors are there because a rate over a handful of emails is noise: one
 * mistyped address in a list of thirty is 3%, and is nobody's bad list.
 *
 * A bounce is only known after the email has gone, so a third thing makes
 * sure few have gone by then:
 *
 *   3. After a store brings in addresses from elsewhere, its emails go out
 *      in portions that double — a hundred people, then two hundred, each a
 *      quarter of an hour after the one before (rampRoom, below). A list
 *      with many dead addresses is found, and paused, while a few hundred
 *      people have been written to rather than every one of them. A good
 *      list is through it in under two hours and never sees it again.
 *
 * What this does not do: it does not know an address is dead before writing
 * to it once. It limits what a bad list can cost to its first portions,
 * where before there was no limit at all.
 *
 *   nl:mail:health:<id>:<YYYY-MM-DD>   s, b, c: sent, bounced, complained
