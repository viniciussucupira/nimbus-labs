/**
 * Searching a community: its posts and the comments under them, the lessons of
 * the courses sold with it, its events, and the people in it.
 *
 * This is the one thing a community needs more of the longer it runs. A feed
 * answers "what is new"; nothing in a feed answers "has this been asked
 * before", and that question is the whole reason an archive is worth paying
 * for. Without it the same question is answered again every week, by hand, by
 * the creator.
 *
 * Why it reaches past posts, measured rather than assumed (checked 30 September
 * 2026): Skool searches posts, comments, course content and members from one
 * box. Circle searches posts, comments, lesson titles and bodies, members with
 * their profile fields, events and messages. Mighty Networks searches posts,
 * comments, coursework, members and events. Whop documents search only of its
 * marketplace and of direct messages. Stan documents no search at all. A
 * community here that could only find posts was behind three of the four that
 * document anything.
 *
 * How it is kept, all under the community's own id:
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:w:<token>    posts holding that word, scored by post number
 *   nl:cm:<id>:wi:<post>    the words that post is indexed under
 *   nl:cm:<id>:wl:<token>   lessons, scored by their place in the course
 *   nl:cm:<id>:wil:<lesson> the words that lesson is indexed under
 *   nl:cm:<id>:we:<token>   events, scored by when they start
 *   nl:cm:<id>:wie:<event>  the words that event is indexed under
 *   nl:cm:<id>:wm:<token>   members, scored by when they joined
 *   nl:cm:<id>:wim:<member> the words that member is indexed under
 *   nl:cm:<id>:q:<nonce>    one search's working set, gone within the minute
 *
 * Each kind is its own index and keeps its own order, and that is also how the
 * results are shown — four lists, not one pile sorted by a number that means a
 * post's place in one and an hour of the day in another. Posts keep the keys
 * they always had, so no store rebuilds an index that is already correct.
 *
 * A hit is a POST, never a comment on its own: the thread is what somebody is
 * looking for, and a comment away from its thread answers nothing. A post is
 * found by the words in its title, in its text, and in every comment under
 * it, so an answer given in the comments is findable by the words of the
 * answer.
 *
 * Scored by post number, which only ever grows, so results read newest first
 * and page exactly as the feed does — a page never repeats or skips while
 * somebody writes.
 *
 * Kept true by reindexing the whole post whenever anything in it changes. A
 * post's words are the union of its own and all its comments', so a deleted
 * comment cannot simply have its words removed — another comment may use the
 * same ones. Reading the post and its comments back is one GET and one
 * HGETALL, bounded by MAX_COMMENTS_PER_POST, and the difference against
 * `wi:<post>` is written. Correct beats clever here: an index that quietly
 * drifts out of step with the posts is worse than no index, because nobody
 * can tell it has.
 *
 * Two bounds worth knowing, both deliberate:
 *
 *   - At most MAX_INDEXED_WORDS distinct words per post are indexed. A post
 *     with 300 long comments under it can run past that; the words after it
 *     are not searchable. The cap is what keeps one community's index from
 *     growing without limit, and it is set high enough that ordinary writing
 *     never reaches it.
 *   - Words are matched whole, not by prefix. "pay" does not find "payment".
 *
 * Nothing here decides who may see what, and that matters more now than it did
 * with posts alone. The caller filters everything that comes back through the
 * same gates the pages themselves use: a space through the feed's gate, a
 * lesson through whether that address holds the product the course is sold
 * with, an event through mayAttend, a member through whether they asked to be
 * listed. Searching is not a way around a door, and a title is content — a
 * lesson called "The $40k month spreadsheet" tells somebody who has not bought it
 * something they did not pay for.
