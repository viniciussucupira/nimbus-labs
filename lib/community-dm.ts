/**
 * Private messages inside a community.
 *
 * What the others do, checked on 30 September 2026, because "better" has to
 * mean something you can point at:
 *
 *   Stan     none. No member-to-member, no member-to-creator. Its AutoDM is
 *            Instagram automation and has nothing to do with the community.
 *   Circle   the best controls found: four switches on the community (enable
 *            messaging, member-to-member, group, voice) and two on the
 *            account (prevent members messaging me, disable DMs entirely),
 *            and an admin cannot read a member's messages.
 *   Whop     the best abuse handling found, but on its chat rooms rather than
 *            on DMs: mute with a duration, a cooldown between messages, a
 *            banned-word list, blocking links and uploads.
 *   Kajabi   creator-to-member only on the current product; member-to-member
 *            only survives on its legacy communities.
 *   Skool    DMs to anybody in your communities, from the $9 plan up.
 *
 * So: Circle's switches, Whop's rate limiting, and one thing none of the five
 * has — **the first message from someone you have never spoken to arrives as a
 * request.** It sits in its own list, it cannot be seen from the conversation
 * list, and it becomes a conversation only when the person accepts. Decline
 * and it goes, and that sender cannot open another request.
 *
 * That is the difference between DMs a creator turns on and DMs a creator
 * turns off after the first bad week. Every platform that offers open DMs
 * offers, along with them, the ability for any member to write to any other
 * member unasked. A request queue costs the honest sender one extra step and
 * costs the unwanted one everything.
 *
 * Two rules that are not settings, because they should not be anybody's to
 * change:
 *
 *   - The creator never reads a conversation they are not in. There is no
 *     moderation view of member-to-member messages, and the pages say so.
 *   - A muted or removed member cannot send. Reading what was already said to
 *     them stays possible; a mute is not a way to make evidence disappear.
 *
 * How it is kept, all under the community's own id:
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:dm:<pair>        the messages, newest last (list, capped)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:dm:i:<who>       their conversations, by when each last moved
 *   nl:cm:<id>:dm:q:<who>       requests waiting on them, newest first
 *   nl:cm:<id>:dm:x:<who>       who they have declined, and so will not hear from again
 *   nl:cm:<id>:dm:r:<pair>      how much of it each of the two has read
 *
 * A pair names itself: the two member keys, sorted, joined by a dot. Sorting
 * is what makes one conversation rather than two halves of one.
