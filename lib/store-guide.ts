/**
 * The store page's guide (added 9 October 2026): a visitor says what they
 * want to get done, and is shown which of the creator's products fit, and
 * why, picked by a model from what the store says about its products and
 * nothing else. Hotmart, Kajabi, Stan and the rest leave a visitor with a
 * list to read; a store with ten products loses the ones who cannot tell
 * which is theirs.
 *
 * It is the product pages' answers (lib/answers.ts) for the whole store, and
 * draws on the same allowance a month, switched on by the same setting: one
 * request to the smallest model, with the same ceiling on what it is given,
 * so one pick costs no more than one answer. The same words about the same
 * catalog are answered from memory for a day. What was looked for and not
 * found goes on the creator's list of unanswered questions, filed under the
 * store page, never with who asked.
