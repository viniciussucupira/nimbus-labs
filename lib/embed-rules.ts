/**
 * A product sold from the creator's own website: the code they paste there.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (7 October 2026). Gumroad lets a creator put
 * a product on their own site, as a button or an embedded card (its help
 * center, "Build Gumroad into your website"). Stan cannot: its checkout lives
 * at stan.store/<name> and nowhere else, and this site said the same of
 * itself on its comparison page. A creator who already has a blog, a
 * Squarespace page or a portfolio had to send readers away to a link in bio
 * before they could buy.
 *
 * Two things can be pasted, and both are plain HTML, so they go into any
 * page builder that takes HTML (an "Embed", "Code" or "Custom HTML" block)
 * without a script of ours running on the creator's site:
 *
 *   - a card: a frame holding the product's picture, title, price, its
 *     buyers' rating and the buy button. It is drawn by this site on every
 *     visit, so a price changed in the studio, a sale or a sell-out shows on
 *     the creator's site at once. The button opens Stripe's checkout in a new
 *     tab: Stripe will not be drawn inside a frame, and a new tab is the one
 *     way out of a frame that every page builder allows (several hold pasted
 *     code inside a frame of their own that may not move the page).
 *
 *   - a button: a plain link to the product's own page, in the store's
 *     colour, for a page that takes no frames. It says what the creator typed.
 *
 * Both carry utm tags naming where they were pasted, so a sale made through
 * them is reported under that name with the store's other sources
 * (lib/came-from.ts). Nothing else is counted and no cookie is set: the
 * frame is not counted as a visit, because it is drawn on every page of the
 * creator's site whether or not anyone looks at it.
 *
 * Browser-safe: the studio builds the code with these, and the page that
 * draws the card reads the same names.
