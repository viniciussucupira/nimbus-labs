/**
 * What Nimbus writes down about a booked call besides Stripe.
 *
 * Stripe stays the ledger of who paid for which time: the checkout's metadata
 * says the start it was bought for, and nothing here rewrites it. Two things
 * happen after a payment that Stripe has no place for, and they are kept
 * here:
 *
 *   - a move: the buyer took their booking to another time from the link in
 *     their email. The new time is written against the checkout session, and
 *     everything that reads a booking — the busy times, the studio, the
 *     thanks page, the calendar file, the reminders — reads it through
 *     `readMoves`, so the old time is free and the new one taken everywhere
 *     at once;
 *   - the reminders still to send: one queue, scored by when each is due, read
 *     by the five-minute mail job (lib/call-reminders.ts).
 *
 *   nl:call:moved:<session>   { s, e, n }: new start, new end, moves so far
 *   nl:call:remindq           "<callsId>|<handle>|<session>|<mark>|<start>"
 *
 * A mark is "c" (check, about half an hour after a checkout opens, that a
 * buyer who paid and never came back still gets their confirmation), "24" or
 * "1" (hours before the call). A reminder names the start it was planned for,
 * so one planned before a move is recognised as out of date and dropped.
