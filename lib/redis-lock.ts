/**
 * A lock in Redis that only its holder can let go of, and that a write can
 * check it still holds before it lands.
 *
 * Several records here are read, changed and written back: a store and its
 * product index (lib/store.ts), a store's team (lib/team.ts). Two requests
 * doing that at the same instant would each write back what they read, and
 * the second would quietly undo the first — a product that vanishes from the
 * index, a person taken off a team who is back a moment later. So each
 * change takes the record's lock first, and the next one waits its turn.
 *
 * The lock is a key set with NX and an expiry, holding a random token of the
 * request that took it. Three things about it are done in one step on the
 * Redis side, with a short script, because doing them as two commands leaves
 * a gap another request can fall into:
 *
 *   - letting go deletes the key only if it still holds our token, so a lock
 *     that ran out and was taken by the next request is never deleted by us;
 *   - holding on (before a write that matters) makes the lock last longer,
 *     again only if it is still ours, and says whether it was;
 *   - a fenced write sets a record only while the lock is still ours, so a
 *     request that was held up past its lock's expiry — a slow network, a
 *     paused function — cannot land a stale copy over a newer one.
 *
 * Upstash runs these scripts (EVAL). Where a Redis does not, each falls back
 * to the same checks made as separate commands, which keeps the rules and
 * only loses the single step; the stand-ins the local checks use are like
 * that.
