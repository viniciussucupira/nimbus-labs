/**
 * Selling something that lives somewhere else.

 * Not every product fits in a file we host. A course of twelve videos, a

 * same escape hatch Stan calls "Redirect to URL", and it costs a creator
 * nothing to use and costs us nothing to run.
 *
 * The link is the whole product, so it is checked like one. A buyer who has
 * paid is about to be sent wherever this points, and the person who typed it
 * is not us.
