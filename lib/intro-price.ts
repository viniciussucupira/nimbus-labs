/**
 * An introductory price for a membership (added 10 October 2026): "$5 the
 * first month, then $20 a month", or "$5 a month for the first 3 months,
 * then $20 a month". The rules, which the browser can read too; the coupon
 * that takes it off at checkout is made in lib/intro-coupon.ts.
 *
 * What keeps it honest and simple:
 *
 *   - It is said before anybody pays, everywhere the membership's price is
 *     said: the product's facts, its button, the line under the button, the
 *     course page, the renewal page and the reminder after an unpaid checkout.
 *     Stripe's own page shows the discount line too.
 *   - It is a price, not a percentage: the creator types what the first
 *     payments cost, always less than the regular price and never below what
 *     Stripe will charge. The regular price is what the member pays after.
 *   - One offer at a time. Not beside a free trial (a trial is the creator's
 *     other way to start a member off), not on a membership with a set number
 *     of payments or with several prices, and not on plans members switch
 *     between, where a fixed amount off could follow them to a cheaper plan.
 *   - Taken off by Stripe with a coupon on the creator's own account, for the
 *     first payment, or the first months of a monthly membership, so the
 *     regular price begins by itself.
 *   - A come-back offer (lib/winback.ts) replaces it: one discount at a time.
