/**
 * A private video room for each booking, with nothing to set up.
 *
 * A creator selling calls either types the meeting link they already use —
 * Zoom, Google Meet, whatever — or asks for a room to be made for every
 * booking. The room is a Jitsi Meet address (https://meet.jit.si/<name>)
 * whose name is 24 random letters and digits, 120 bits drawn from the
 * system's secure random source, so nobody finds it by guessing. Jitsi Meet
 * is a free service run by a third party (8x8), with no account to open and
 * no key for us to hold: a room exists the moment somebody opens its
 * address.
 *
 * One thing about it has to be said wherever it is offered: since August
 * 2023 meet.jit.si asks the first person who opens a room to sign in (with a
 * Google, GitHub or Facebook account, the ones it accepts today) before the
 * meeting starts, and that person becomes its moderator; the others wait
 * until then and need no account. The studio says so, and so does every
 * email that carries a room.
 *
 * Which room a booking has:
 *
 *   - a one-to-one call: one room per booking, filed under its checkout
 *     session, so a booking its buyer moves keeps its room;
 *   - a group call or a dated live session: one room per time, shared by
 *     everyone booked into it — a group has to meet in the same place — so a
 *     booking moved to another time joins the room of that time.
 *
 * A room is made the first time anything asks for it — the booking email,
 * usually — with SET NX, so two buyers of the same group time at the same
 * instant still get the same room. Once made it stays the booking's room even
 * if the creator later switches back to their own link; a booking made
 * before rooms were switched on keeps the link it was given.
 *
 * A call made on Google Meet or Zoom (lib/meet-links.ts) is read here too,
 * first: the link its record says the booking was given wins over anything
 * else, so every page, email and calendar file shows the same one. Until a
 * record exists — a page drawn in the second before the booking is
 * confirmed — such a call shows what it would fall back to: the creator's
 * own link, or a room made here when they have none.
