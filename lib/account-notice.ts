/**
 * Telling a creator, by email, when something that decides where their money
 * or their buyers go has just changed.
 *
 * Signing in is passwordless, so the account is exactly as safe as the inbox
 * and the sessions it opens. Someone who got hold of a session — a borrowed
 * laptop, a cookie that walked off — would go for the few settings that
 * matter: the Stripe account sales are paid into, the currency every price
 * is charged in, the domain the store is served on, the webhooks, the
 * email platform and the Google Calendar or Zoom account that send buyers'
 * details somewhere, the people let onto
 * the store's team (lib/team.ts), and the devices told about every sale. So
 * each change to one of those sends the creator a plain notice at their
 * sign-in address, saying what changed and when, and what to do if it was
 * not them. It carries no link that signs anybody in; it says where to go.
 *
 * Best effort by design: a notice that could not be sent never undoes or
 * blocks the change itself, which the creator made on purpose far more
 * often than not.
