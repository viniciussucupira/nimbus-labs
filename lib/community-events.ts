/**
 * Live events inside a store's community: a workshop, a Q&A, a coworking
 * hour, put on the community's calendar by the creator for its members.
 *
 * An event has a title, a few words about it, a start in the creator's time
 * zone, a length, and optionally a cap on how many may come and a list of
 * the community's products whose buyers alone it is for. It happens in one of
 * three places:
 *
 *   - a private video room made for it, by the rules of lib/call-rooms.ts: a
 *     Jitsi Meet address with 24 random letters and digits, made when the
 *     event is, and kept by it whatever happens after;
 *   - the creator's own meeting link — Zoom, Google Meet, anything https;
 *   - or, when the store has connected Google Calendar or Zoom
 *     (lib/meet-connect.ts), a Google Meet or Zoom meeting made on that
 *     account for the event (lib/event-meetings.ts), with the same fallback
 *     a call has: when it cannot be made, the event's own private room.
 *
 * Who sees what is decided on every request, never from anything a page was
 * shown earlier:
 *
 *   - the community's own door first (lib/community-access.ts): a membership
 *     that lapsed, a refund, a member taken out, and the events are gone
 *     with the rest of it;
 *   - then, for an event kept for the buyers of some products, whether this
 *     address holds one of those — asked of the creator's Stripe account and
 *     kept five minutes (one while the answer is no), under a key of its own;
 *   - the way in — the room or the link — is written into a page only from
 *     JOIN_EARLY_MINUTES before the start until the end, only to somebody
 *     let into the event, and, when the event has a cap, only to those who
 *     have a place. Emails, calendar files and the feed never carry it: they
 *     point at the event's page, which asks all of this again.
 *
 * A place is taken with one click (RSVP) and given back with another. A cap
 * holds when many press at once: taking a place writes the member down and
 * reads how many are on the list in the same trip to Redis, and a list
 * longer than the cap takes that member back out. Whoever stays saw a list no
 * longer than the cap after writing themselves down, so however the requests
 * interleave, the list can never settle above the cap. The list is its own
 * count: there is no second number to drift from it.
 *
 * Kept under the community's own id, so nothing here reaches another store:
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ev:<event>            one event (JSON)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:evs                   every event kept, by start (sorted set)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ev:<event>:r          who is coming: member key -> when (hash)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ev:<event>:n          (older events only) a count kept beside the list; unused now
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ev:<event>:ok:<addr>  Stripe's answer for an event kept for some products
 *   nl:cm:<id>:evlock:<event>        held while the creator changes the event
 *   nl:cm:evq                        reminders and notices due, by when (sorted set;
 *                                    lib/community-event-mail.ts sends them)
 *
 * At most MAX_UPCOMING_EVENTS are coming up at once; the ones that are over
 * are kept, replays and all, up to MAX_KEPT_EVENTS in all, after which the
 * oldest one that is over makes room for a new one. Every limit is in
 * lib/community-text.ts, where the studio reads it too.
