/**
 * Reminders before a booked call, sent by the five-minute mail job.
 *
 * Each booking gets two, to the buyer: a day before and an hour before, in
 * the buyer's own time zone, with the meeting link, a link to the calendar
 * file and, while it can still be moved, the link to move it. The creator
 * gets one email per time rather than per buyer — at the same two moments —
 * listing everyone booked into it, so a group call of forty is one email.
 *
 * What is due is read from the queue in lib/call-records.ts, planned when a
 * booking is confirmed or moved. Nothing in the queue is trusted beyond "look
 * at this booking now": the booking itself is read from the creator's Stripe
 * account, with its move applied, and a reminder whose booking is no longer
 * paid, or no longer at the time it was planned for, is dropped. Each email
 * is guarded by its own key, so a run that dies half way and the run after
 * it never send the same reminder twice.
 *
 * The same queue carries one check per checkout, made once it has closed: a
 * buyer who paid and never came back to the store is confirmed then, so
 * their confirmation — and their reminders — do not wait for somebody to open
 * the store or the studio.
