/**
 * Preparing an affiliate payout: the file the creator uploads to their own
 * PayPal or Wise, and the record of having paid.
 *
 * The rule from lib/affiliates.ts does not bend here. Nimbus never holds,
 * moves or pays out any of this money. What this file does is turn what the
 * book says is owed into a batch file shaped the way the creator's own
 * provider reads it, so paying twenty affiliates is one upload instead of
 * twenty transfers typed by hand. The money leaves the creator's own account,
 * the creator confirms it in their own provider, and only then is it written
 * down here as paid.
 *
 * That is the whole difference from a platform that pays affiliates "for
 * you": those pay out of money they are already holding, which is why their
 * creators have to wait for a payout in the first place. Here the money never
 * left the creator, so there is nothing to wait for — only a file to hand to
 * the provider they already use.
 *
 * Two files are built, because the two providers do not read the same shape:
 *
 *   - PayPal Payouts, exactly as PayPal's own documentation writes it: no
 *     header row, the columns in their order, one currency per file, a
 *     period for the decimal in USD, CAD and GBP and a comma inside quotes
 *     for the rest, and at most 5000 rows. Uploaded to PayPal as it is.
 *   - a payout worksheet, with a header, for Wise and for a bank transfer.
 *     Wise will only read a file built from the template it gives you, so
 *     this one is for pasting into that template — and it leaves the
 *     recipient's name blank, because Nimbus never asks an affiliate for the
 *     name on their bank account and will not invent one.
 *
 * Nothing here decides what is owed: that is lib/affiliates.ts readBook, which
 * works it out against the refunds on the creator's Stripe account. Only
 * affiliates owed more than nothing, in the store's own currency, are in a
 * file — an affiliate whose sales were in a currency the store has since
 * changed away from is left out of the totals there, and so is left out here.
