/**
 * The reminder a buyer asks for themselves.
 *
 * The reminder after an unpaid checkout (lib/checkout-recovery.ts) rested
 * entirely on Stripe's own consent box, and Stripe puts that box only on the
 * checkouts of businesses in the United States. A creator in Europe or Canada
 * could not have the reminder at all — and it is, with the welcome, the
 * automatic email a store earns most from. Stripe hands over the address of
 * somebody who left only when that box was checked, so for every other
 * account there was no address and no yes.
 *
 * So the yes is asked for where we can ask it: on the way back. A buyer who
 * leaves Stripe's checkout without paying lands on a page of the store that
 * says nothing was charged, links back to the product, and offers one thing —
 * "leave your email and get one reminder with the link, in about an hour."
 * Whoever types an address there has asked, in so many words, for exactly
 * the email they then get. That holds in every country, which is why it is
 * offered by every store with reminders on, a US one included: it reaches
 * the buyer who did not check Stripe's box and still pressed back.
 *
 * What it is not: a way to collect addresses. An ask is one email about one
 * product. It puts nobody on the creator's list and shows the creator no
 * address, and it leaves this queue within the hour — sent, or dropped
 * because they bought in the meantime. What stays afterward is only what
 * makes the stop link in that email work (lib/checkout-recovery.ts).
 *
 * What stands in front of it, since a public form that sends email is a
 * thing to be careful with:
 *
 *   - A few asks an hour from one connection, and a ceiling a day for one
 *     store, so the form cannot be turned on somebody's inbox or run up a
 *     bill. Past either, the page says so and nothing is kept.
 *   - Everything the other reminder checks (lib/checkout-recovery.ts,
 *     deliver): once per address and product in a week, never to an address
 *     that pressed stop or left the creator's list, never to somebody who has
 *     paid since, with the stop link and the creator's postal address.
 *   - The email itself says why it came: "you asked for it on this store".
 *     Somebody whose address was typed by another person gets one email,
 *     saying that, with a link that stops them for good.
 *
 *   nl:recover:asks     asks waiting, by when each is due (a sorted set)
