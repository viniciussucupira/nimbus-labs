/**
 * Use past what a plan covers, put on the creator's next invoice.
 *
 * Two things here are charged by use: lesson video watched past a plan's
 * hours (lib/watch-rules.ts) and visits to a store past a plan's visits
 * (lib/traffic-rules.ts). Each keeps its own count (lib/watch.ts,
 * lib/traffic.ts) and has its own price; this is the part they share, the
 * daily job's part (app/api/cron/usage): for every store past what its plan
 * covers it works out what the month has come to, takes away what was
 * already put on an invoice, and adds the difference as one line on the
 * store's own subscription (lib/billing.ts, addToNextInvoice). Stripe
 * charges it with the plan, to the card the plan is paid with. Nobody has to
 * notice, and nobody is cut off.
 *
 * Each thing charged this way is a Meter, and keeps its records under its
 * own name:
 *
 *   nl:<name>:billed:<folder>:<month>   cents of that month already on an invoice
 *   nl:<name>:adding:<folder>:<month>   a line being added, until it is known to be there
 *   nl:<name>:told:<folder>:<month>     the creator was written to about that month
 *   nl:watch:monthly:<subscription>     a yearly plan was set to bill added lines monthly
 *
 * Never twice. What is being added is written down before Stripe is asked,
 * with a mark that goes on the line itself. If the answer never comes back,
 * the next run looks for the mark before it adds anything: found, the line
 * is counted as billed; not found, the same request is made again under the
 * same key, which Stripe will not carry out a second time.
 *
 * While a month is running a line is added only once it is worth a dollar,
 * so an invoice does not fill with one-cent lines. When the month is over
 * whatever is left is added, down to the cent.
