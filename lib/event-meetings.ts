/**
 * A Google Meet or Zoom meeting for a community live event, made on the
 * store's own connected account — the same machinery a call uses
 * (lib/meet-links.ts, meetingFor), with a scope of the event's own.
 *
 * The creator picks "Google Meet (automatic)" or "Zoom (automatic)" as where
 * an event happens, offered only while that account is connected and works
 * (lib/meet-connect.ts, usableProviders). Then:
 *
 *   - scheduling it makes one meeting for the event, a Google Calendar event
 *     on the creator's primary calendar with a Meet link, or a scheduled
 *     Zoom meeting;
 *   - moving it moves the meeting, keeping its link; cancelling it removes
 *     the meeting; switching to another place removes it too;
 *   - nobody is put on the meeting's guest list. A call's buyer is (their
 *     link is in their emails anyway), but an event's way in is its page
 *     alone, shown fifteen minutes before, only to members who may come,
 *     asked again on every visit (lib/community-events.ts). A guest list
 *     would put the Meet link in each member's own Google Calendar days
 *     early, keep it there after their membership lapsed, and let them
 *     straight in — and would send members' addresses to Google. So on
 *     Google Meet members ask to join and the host lets them in; on Zoom
 *     they wait until the host starts it.
 *
 * The fallback is the call's: when the meeting cannot be made — the provider
 * did not answer, the connection broke — the event uses the private video
 * room it always has (lib/community-events.ts), the problem is written down
 * for the studio, and the five-minute job tries again (lib/call-meetings.ts)
 * while the event is more than two hours away. Nobody has been given a link
 * by then: the way in is only written into the event's page from fifteen
 * minutes before the start, and emails, calendar files and the feed never
 * carry it, so a meeting made late replaces the room without anybody having
 * to be told. Nearer the start, the link people will see does not change.
 *
 * Each provider has its own scope, so a switch from one to the other never
 * writes over a removal that is still being retried:
 *
 *   e:<community id>:<event id>:g    the Google event
 *   e:<community id>:<event id>:z    the Zoom meeting
