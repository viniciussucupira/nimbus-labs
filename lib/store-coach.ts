/**
 * The store coach (added 9 October 2026): once a store is set up, what it
 * already does to sell, what it does not do yet, and a score out of 100.
 *
 * The "Getting your store ready" steps (components/studio-start.tsx) end
 * when a store can take money; Stan, Kajabi, Hotmart and the rest stop
 * there too. This goes on: each check is something stores that sell well
 * have — a picture and a line on every product, a sales page, a way to
 * stay in touch, answers before buying, reviews asked for, a blog — weighed
 * by how much a buyer misses it, each with the one place to fix it.
 *
 * Read only from the store's own record and the listings it already
 * carries (the first page's), so the studio asks nothing more to show it.
 * Pure, so it can be tested.
