/**
 * The checks every request that changes something has to pass, written once.
 *
 * Until now each route carried its own copy of the origin check, and each
 * copy had the same gap: a request with no Origin header at all was waved
 * through. Browsers send Origin on a cross-site POST today, but they also
 * send Sec-Fetch-Site, which says outright whether the request came from
 * this site, and a check that reads both is a check that does not depend on
 * one header being present. The proxy (proxy.ts) applies this to every
 * request under /api/ that is not a read, so a route added tomorrow is
 * covered before anyone remembers to add the check to it; the routes keep
 * their own checks as well, so neither is the only one.
 *
 * The rest is what those routes kept writing by hand:
 *
 *   - a body read with a ceiling, counted as it arrives rather than trusted
 *     from Content-Length, which a client may leave out;
 *   - a counter per client and per purpose, for the public forms that start
 *     something that costs the creator (a Stripe checkout, a held unit or a
 *     held call time) or fills somebody's inbox;
 *   - a comparison of secrets that takes the same time whether the first
 *     character is wrong or the last, so the scheduled jobs' secret cannot be
 *     found one character at a time by timing the answer;
 *   - the Content-Disposition header for a file whose name somebody typed,
 *     which must survive quotes, accents and emoji without breaking the
 *     response or the header around it.
 *
 * Nothing here needs Node's own modules, so the proxy can use it as it is.
