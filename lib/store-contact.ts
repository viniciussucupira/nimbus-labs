/**
 * The contact form on a store page (added 9 October 2026): a visitor writes
 * to the creator — a question before buying, a collaboration, a booking —
 * and the message lands in the creator's own inbox, with "Reply" going
 * straight back to the visitor.
 *
 * It only ever writes to the creator. Nothing is sent to the address a
 * visitor types, so the form cannot be used to email anybody else; that
 * address is only where the creator's reply will go. A few messages an hour
 * from one connection, and at most MAX_PER_DAY a day to one store, so a
 * creator is never flooded and the sends stay a small, fixed cost.
