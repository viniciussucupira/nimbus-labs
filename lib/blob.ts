/**
 * Vercel Blob, with a limit on how long we wait (lib/fetch-timeout.ts).
 *
 * The same functions as "@vercel/blob", taking the same arguments, for every
 * server file to import instead of it. Each call is given an abort signal:
 * BLOB_TIMEOUT_MS (15 s) to an answer — for `get`, until the download
 * starts, never cutting the file short once it is flowing to the buyer —
 * and BLOB_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS (45 s) for `put`, which writes a stamped PDF of
 * up to 50 MB. The SDK tries a failed request again by itself (up to ten
 * times); the limit covers all of its tries together, so a store that keeps
 * failing cannot hold a page for minutes. Given up, a call fails as one that
 * could not reach Blob does, and every caller already handles that: a
 * download says it could not fetch the file, a removal is logged and left.
 *
 * Signing a URL (presignUrl) is worked out here without asking Blob, so it
 * is passed through as it is.
