/**
 * A pass over each store's recent checkouts, for what the thanks page cannot
 * be trusted to do alone.
 *
 * The thanks page confirms a purchase the moment the buyer lands on it. A
 * buyer who closes the tab while Stripe is sending them there never lands,
 * and a checkout that closes unpaid has no page at all. So the five-minute
 * job walks the stores a slice at a time and, for each one that sells, asks
 * the creator's own Stripe account for the checkouts of the last day — one
 * request per hundred — and hands each on:
 *
 *   - a settled one that has not been confirmed gets its confirmation
 *     (lib/purchase-email.ts);
 *   - a closed, unpaid one on a store with reminders on is offered to
 *     lib/checkout-recovery.ts, which sends only if the buyer agreed;
 *   - a settled one that came through an affiliate's link is written down
 *     for that affiliate (lib/affiliates.ts), once;
 *   - a settled one not yet told to the creator's phone or email platform
 *     is told now (lib/sale-events.ts), once, on a store that connected
 *     either.
 *
 * A store that hands out license keys also has its refunds read, and the
 * key of every sale refunded in full is revoked (lib/licence-keys.ts), so
 * the creator's software hears about a refund within minutes, without the
 * creator having to go and revoke it by hand. A store whose buyers have
 * written reviews has its refunds read in the same way, and each review a
 * payment refunded in full paid for is marked "refunded", which takes its
 * stars out of the average (lib/reviews.ts).
 *
 * Bounded three ways, so it can never run away with the job: a time budget
 * the caller sets, at most three pages of a hundred checkouts per store, and
 * a place in the list of stores kept in Redis, so each run carries on where
 * the last one stopped and every store is reached in turn. Both emails are
 * guarded by their own marks, so a store seen twice is only work, never a
 * second email.
