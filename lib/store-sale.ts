/**
 * A sale across the store: a percentage off, from one moment to another,
 * shown on every product it covers with the old price crossed out, and taken
 * off on Stripe's page with no code to type.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Stan has discount codes
 * with an expiry date, on its $99 plan (help.stan.store, article 43), which
 * the buyer has to know and type; no price crossed out on the store and no
 * sale that starts and ends by itself.
 *
 * What makes it honest:
 *
 *   - the end is real. After it, the store shows the normal price and the
 *     coupon behind the sale no longer works, because Stripe itself refuses
 *     it after the end (redeem_by), so nobody is told "ends Friday" of a sale
 *     that quietly goes on;
 *   - the price shown is Stripe's arithmetic: a percentage off each line,
 *     rounded to the cent the way Stripe rounds it;
 *   - it covers what can be bought once at one price: a download, a link, a
 *     course, a bundle. Not a membership, whose later payments would be at
 *     the full price, not a call, not a product with price options, not one
 *     where the buyer names the price, and not a payment plan, which is said
 *     on the page ("sale price when paid in full").
 *
 * Kept on the store record; the coupon is made on the creator's own Stripe
 * account when the sale is saved.
