/**
 * Captions for a lesson's video: the rules.
 *
 * A creator who has the words of a video written down, timed, uploads that
 * file and the player shows a captions button. The file is one of the two
 * kinds every subtitle tool writes: WebVTT (.vtt), which is what a browser
 * reads, or SubRip (.srt), which is WebVTT with commas where the dots go and
 * a number above each caption. Whichever arrives, what is kept is WebVTT,
 * made here, so the video service is never handed a file as it came.
 *
 * Nothing is written for the creator: no speech is listened to. A file that
 * is not captions is refused rather than kept and shown as nothing.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network; the studio's browser reads the same
 * rules the server holds a file to (lib/stream.ts).
