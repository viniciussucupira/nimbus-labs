/**
 * Keeping every store's "paid up" snapshot true to Stripe, once a day.
 *
 * The snapshot is what lets a buyer's page open without waiting on Stripe,
 * and until now it was refreshed only when its creator opened the studio. A
 * creator who cancelled, or whose card stopped paying, and then simply never
 * came back, kept a till that took money for ever. This closes that, from
 * Stripe's side, without anybody having to open anything:
 *
 *   1. Every subscription on our own account is read, newest first, and the
 *      store named in its metadata is brought in line with it. A subscription
 *      in good standing that its store never wrote down — the creator paid
 *      and the way back did not arrive — is written down, if it is plainly
 *      that store's (lib/billing.ts, ownedBy).
 *   2. Every store that still counts as paid up, and whose subscription the
 *      first step did not see, is asked about on its own. That covers the one
 *      Stripe does not have at all: an id from another key, or another mode.
 *
 * Bounded by a deadline, safe to run as often as it is called, and it only
 * writes where the snapshot is actually wrong. The walk through the stores
 * picks up the next day where it stopped.
