/**
 * Pay what you want: the buyer chooses the price, above a floor the creator
 * sets.
 *
 * The creator's price becomes the minimum, and they add the amount they
 * suggest, which Stripe's checkout shows first in the box the buyer types
 * into. Nothing about the amount is ever read from our own form: Stripe's
 * page takes it, and Stripe refuses anything under the minimum or over the
 * ceiling, so a buyer cannot pay a cent for a $10 floor by editing a page.
 *
 * Stripe only lets a buyer choose the amount of a Price that exists on the
 * account — it cannot be described inline the way every other price here is
 * — so the first checkout creates one on the creator's own account and the
 * id is kept, keyed by everything that shapes it. Changing the title, the
 * floor, the suggestion or the tax setting simply leads to a new one.
 *
 * What it cannot be combined with, and why, is decided here once and read by
 * the studio, the server and the store page alike:
 *
 *   a membership       Stripe lets a buyer choose the amount of a one-off
 *                      payment only, never of a subscription;
 *   price options      the buyer would be choosing twice;
 *   a payment plan     instalments of an amount nobody has chosen yet;
 *   an order bump      the chosen amount has to be the checkout's only line;
 *   a paid call        a call is booked for a time at a set price;
 *   discount codes     not offered: the buyer already names the price.
 *
 * A one-click offer after paying, a limited quantity, sales tax, a course and
 * the questions at checkout all work with it unchanged.
