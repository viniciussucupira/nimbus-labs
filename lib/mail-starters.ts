/**
 * The two sequences that are worth having from the first day, written for the
 * creator and left switched off for them to read.
 *
 * A list earns most from the emails that go out because of something a person
 * did, not from the ones sent to everybody at once: Omnisend's report on 2025
 * (150,000 brands, 27 billion emails) has automated emails at 2% of what was
 * sent and 30% of what email sold, and the welcome and the abandoned checkout
 * between them making three quarters of those orders. The abandoned checkout
 * is a switch here already (lib/checkout-recovery.ts). The welcome, and the
 * note after a first purchase, were a blank form — and a blank form is where
 * most creators stop, so most stores had no sequence at all.
 *
 * So one press makes both:
 *
 *   Welcome                 when somebody joins the list: a hello, then the
 *                           store's first paid product two days later, then
 *                           one more word about it three days after that.
 *   After a first purchase  the first time somebody buys anything: a thank
 *                           you with where their orders are, and, when the
 *                           store sells more than one thing, the rest of it
 *                           a few days later.
 *
 * What they are, so that nothing is sent that the creator did not mean:
 *
 *   - Switched off. They are made as drafts of a sequence; nothing goes to
 *     anybody until the creator has opened one and switched it on.
 *   - Plain words filled in with the store's own name, products and links.
 *     No model writes them, so they cost nothing and say the same thing
 *     every time — and they claim nothing: no result, no number of buyers,
 *     no discount, no deadline. What is true of every store is all they say.
 *   - Only where there is no sequence yet for that moment. A store that has
 *     its own welcome is not given a second one to send beside it.
 *   - Ordinary sequences afterward (lib/flows.ts): edited, paused or deleted
 *     like any other, and counted in the same month of emails.
