/**
 * The terms of a store's affiliate programme, as the store record keeps them.
 *
 * Kept apart from lib/affiliates.ts, which reads and writes the affiliates,
 * their clicks and their sales, so the store record, the studio and the
 * checkout can know the terms without importing anything that talks to
 * Redis, Stripe or the sender.
 *
 * What a creator sets is small on purpose: whether it is on, what share of a
 * sale an affiliate earns — for the whole store, and differently for any
 * product they choose — how long after a click a purchase still counts, and
 * when they pay. Who is let in is the creator's decision, one application at
 * a time — or, when they choose, anybody who has bought from them.
 *
 * The last two are the promise. An affiliate who cannot see when they will be
 * paid has to ask, and asking is the thing every complaint about every
 * platform in this business is really about. So the creator says it once, in
 * the studio, and it is on the page before anybody applies: the day of the
 * month they pay, and how long a sale waits first so their refund window can
 * pass. Marktmorgen then holds them to it — a sale inside the wait is not in the
 * batch, and on the day itself the batch arrives in their inbox.
 */

/**
 * Which affiliate a sale belongs to when the buyer followed more than one
 * link before paying.
 *
 * "last" is the last link they followed, and is the default here and on every
 * other platform: it lets an affiliate win a buyer by offering something
 * better, and it leaves the buyer free to choose whose link to use.
 *
 * "first" is the affiliate who found the buyer in the first place, however
 * many links they followed afterwards. It rewards the person who did the
 * introducing rather than the person who caught them at the till.
 *
 * There is deliberately no third rule splitting one commission between
 * several affiliates. Hotmart offers it and says in its own help pages that
 * professional affiliates feel cheated by it — somebody who bought nothing
 * but a click takes a share of the work another affiliate did. One sale, one
 * affiliate, and the creator chooses which end of the journey counts.
