/**
 * What an email sold: the tag its links carry, so the answer can be read.
 *
 * A creator sends an email and then knows nothing. No opens, no clicks, and
 * no way to tell the email that sold forty plans from the one that sold none
 * — so "which of these is worth sending again?" was answered by feel.
 *
 * The store already knows how to join a visit to its money: the tags on the
 * page a buyer buys from are written into the checkout on the creator's own
 * Stripe account, and come back attached to the sale (lib/came-from.ts). All
 * an email has to do is arrive at the store wearing one.
 *
 * So a link in an email that points at the creator's own store has three
 * tags added to where it goes: utm_source=email, utm_medium saying whether it
 * was a one-off or a sequence, and utm_campaign naming the email. What the
 * reader sees written in the email is the address as the creator typed it.
 *
 * What the tag is, and is not:
 *
 *   - One per email, never one per reader. Everybody who gets the email gets
 *     the same link, so it says which email a sale came from and nothing
 *     about who bought. No pixel, no redirect through us, no profile. (An
 *     email trying two subject lines has one per subject line instead, each
 *     shared by everybody who got that line: lib/mail-test.ts.)
 *   - Only on links to the creator's own store, here or on their own domain.
 *     Somebody else's address is theirs and is left exactly as typed.
 *   - Never over the creator's own. A link that already carries a utm tag is
 *     one they are measuring their own way, and it is not touched.
 *
 * And what it counts, said plainly because the page says it too: a sale made
 * on the page the link opened. Somebody who reads the email on Monday and
 * comes back by themselves on Friday is not counted for it (lib/came-from.ts
 * says why that is the honest limit of a store with no cookie of this kind).
