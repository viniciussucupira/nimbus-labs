/**
 * How long we wait on the services this app runs on before giving up.
 *
 * Every request to Upstash Redis, Stripe (our own account and the creators'
 * connected ones), Resend, Amazon SES, Vercel's domain API, Vercel Blob and the video service goes through
 * `timed`, with a limit of its own:
 *
 *   Redis    5 s    a pipeline answers in milliseconds; five seconds is a
 *                   service that is not there, and every page reads Redis
 *   Stripe   20 s   a charge confirmed with the card's bank can take a few
 *                   seconds; twenty is well past any that succeed
 *   Resend   10 s   one message, or a batch of a hundred
 *   Amazon   8 s    one message handed to Amazon SES, or one question
 *                   about the account (lib/ses.ts)
 *   Domains  15 s   Vercel's domain API, from the studio only
 *   Blob     15 s   to the first byte of an answer (a download may take as
 *                   long as it takes after that); 45 s for writing a
 *                   stamped PDF of up to 50 MB
 *   Video    8 s    one question to the service that keeps lesson videos
 *                   (lib/stream.ts); 3 s when a student's page is waiting
 *
 * Work with a hard end of its own — the five-minute jobs, which Vercel stops
 * at sixty seconds — runs inside `withCutoff`, and then every request made
 * inside it is also given up by that moment, whichever comes first. One
 * cutoff inside another keeps the earlier of the two.
 *
 * A request given up this way fails exactly as one that never reached the
 * service does: `fetch` throws a TypeError ("fetch failed"), and every
 * helper passes that on as it always did. So whatever a caller already does
 * when the network fails — refuse, fall back, keep a charge "pending" and
 * settle it later from what Stripe says — it does on a timeout too, and
 * nothing reads a request that timed out as one that worked. A request that
 * timed out may still have been done on the other side (a charge, an email):
 * the callers that must never do it twice send an idempotency key, and try
 * again with the same one.
