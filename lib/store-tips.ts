/**
 * "Support my work": a visitor gives the creator an amount of their own
 * choosing, with nothing bought and nothing to deliver (added 9 October 2026).
 *
 * What Ko-fi and Buy Me a Coffee are built on, and what Linktree and Beacons
 * sell as a tip jar: a fan who has nothing they need to buy today still wants
 * to say thank you, and a box with three amounts and one button lets them.
 *
 * The rules, browser-safe: what the creator keeps on the store's record and
 * which amounts a visitor may give. The payment itself is one Stripe checkout
 * on the creator's own account (lib/store-tip-checkout.ts), like every sale
 * here, so the money is theirs from the first second and none of it is ours.
 *
 * What it is not: a product. Nothing is handed over for it, so it earns no
 * affiliate or partner share, takes no discount code and no sales tax, and is
 * never "refunded" by taking anything back. It is listed with the store's
 * sales as "Support", with whatever message the visitor left.
