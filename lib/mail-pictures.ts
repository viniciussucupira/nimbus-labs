/**
 * A picture for a creator's email, kept (the rules are in
 * lib/mail-picture-rules.ts). Made smaller in the creator's browser before
 * it is sent (components/mail-picture-button.tsx), and held here to the
 * checks every picture on this site is: a JPEG by its own first bytes, its
 * size read from the file itself, at most MAX_MAIL_PICTURE_BYTES, then kept
 * under a new name in the store's own picture folder, never written over.
 *
 * A picture in an email is kept for as long as the store is: an email once
 * sent can be opened years later, and a picture taken away from it would
 * leave a hole in the creator's own words. It counts as a small file in the
 * store's folder, as a product's picture does.
