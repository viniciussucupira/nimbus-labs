/**
 * Lesson video that plays the way a video site plays it: the rules.
 *
 * A lesson's video used to be the file as the creator uploaded it, handed to
 * the browser whole. That plays, and on a slow line it stops and waits: a
 * gigabyte filmed on a phone is sent at the rate it was filmed at, whatever
 * the line can carry. A video site does not stop because it keeps several
 * copies of each video, each smaller than the last, cut into pieces of a few
 * seconds, and the player asks for the next piece in the size the line can
 * carry right now.
 *
 * Making those copies is a service's job (lib/stream.ts says which, and
 * why). This file holds what can be said without asking it anything, so the
 * studio's browser reads the same rules the server holds an upload to:
 *
 *   - where such a video is written down. A lesson keeps one handle to its
 *     video, a path (lib/product-file.ts). A video kept by the service has a
 *     path of its own shape, `stream/<store's folder>/<lesson>/<video id>`,
 *     so everything that already carries a lesson's video carries this one,
 *     and the two kinds are told apart by the path alone;
 *   - what state the service says a video is in, read from its own numbers;
 *   - how much one viewing is counted as, for the month's delivery
 *     (lib/delivery.ts).
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network or a secret.
