/**
 * Who may do what in a store's studio, written once.
 *
 * A store has one owner — the account that made it — and up to five people
 * the owner invites (lib/team.ts). Each of them has one of three roles, and a
 * role is nothing but a list of the permissions below. Every studio route
 * names the one permission it needs and asks lib/studio-route.ts, which reads
 * this table and nothing else; the studio pages read the same table to leave
 * out what a role cannot use. So a role changes in one place, and the screen
 * and the server can never disagree about it.
 *
 * The lines drawn:
 *
 *   - Owner: everything. Only the owner pays for the store, connects the
 *     Stripe account its sales go into, manages the team and deletes the
 *     store — the four things that decide where money goes and who is let in.
 *   - Admin: everything else — the store's address, domain, pixels, tax,
 *     webhooks, discounts, affiliates and their payouts, sending email, the
 *     files of buyers' addresses and sales, and bringing contacts, products
 *     and past buyers over from another platform (lib/imports.ts).
 *   - Editor: the catalogue and the page — products, prices, files, courses,
 *     calls, offers after paying, sales pages, the store's name, look and
 *     links, the community's live events — plus moderating the community
 *     and the reviews, and writing email drafts. No sending to the list,
 *     nothing about payments, no files of buyers' data and no imports.
 *   - Support: reading orders and bookings, sending a buyer their purchase
 *     email again, and moderating the community and the reviews — which
 *     includes seeing who said they are coming to a live event, not
 *     scheduling one. Nothing that edits the store.
 *
 * Nothing in this file reads a secret or the environment, so the browser may
 * import it to decide what to draw.
