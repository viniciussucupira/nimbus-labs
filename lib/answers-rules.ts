/**
 * A visitor's question about a product, answered from what its page says.
 * Rules the browser can read too; the part that asks the model, counts and
 * remembers is lib/answers.ts, which only the server loads.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (7 October 2026): Kajabi sells a "Sales
 * Agent" that answers pre-purchase questions on landing and checkout pages,
 * at $79 a month for each agent on top of its plan. Hotmart's Tutor and
 * Stan's AI Twin answer members and fans, after the sale. A visitor with one
 * question left — is it a PDF, how long do I have access, is there a refund —
 * either finds the answer in the next few seconds or leaves.
 *
 * What it is, and what keeps it honest:
 *
 *   - Off until the creator switches it on. An answer given in a creator's
 *     name is theirs to allow.
 *   - It answers only from what the product's own page says — its title,
 *     price, description, the blocks of its sales page — and from the notes
 *     the creator writes for it. When the page does not answer the question,
 *     it says exactly that, and the question is shown to the creator (with
 *     no name, address or anything else about who asked), who then knows what
 *     their page is missing. That list is the second half of the feature.
 *   - It never states a price, a refund, a deadline or a result that is not
 *     on the page, and the box says in plain words that the answer is
 *     automatic.
 *
 * What keeps it from costing more than it earns. Each answer is one request
 * to the smallest current model, a fraction of a cent (Haiku 5.5 at $0.10
 * and $0.50 per million tokens in and out, read on 7 October 2026: under
 * $0.001 for the longest page and answer allowed). A store gets a number of
 * answers a month by its plan, below; past it the box closes by itself until
 * the month turns. At the largest allowance that is a few dollars a month in
 * the worst case, on a $249 plan. The same question about the same page is
 * answered from memory for a day and costs nothing.
