/**
 * Which ways to pay a buyer meets at checkout.
 *
 * No checkout here names its payment methods. Stripe then offers what the
 * creator switched on in their own Stripe dashboard (their payment method
 * settings for this platform), narrowed to what fits the buyer, the
 * currency and the amount: cards, Apple Pay and Google Pay, Link, and — where
 * the creator's account and currency allow them — PayPal, Klarna, Afterpay
 * or Clearpay, Affirm, iDEAL, Bancontact and the rest. A membership or a
 * payment plan is a subscription, and Stripe shows only the methods it can
 * charge again each period. So more ways to pay is the creator's switch,
 * not ours, and the studio links straight to it (lib/payment-methods.ts).
 *
 * Only ways to pay that settle while the buyer is on the page are kept.
 * Every product here is handed over the moment Stripe says it is paid: the
 * file on the thanks page, the course, the booked call. A bank debit, a cash
 * voucher or a crypto transfer says "complete" at checkout and "paid" days
 * later, so a buyer would pay and meet a page saying nothing was paid. Those
 * methods are left out of the checkout rather than apologised for after it.
