/**
 * A test meeting, made on the account a creator has just connected.
 *
 * Connecting Google Calendar or Zoom says only that the provider let us in.
 * Whether a meeting is really made there shows the first time somebody
 * books a call, which is the worst moment to find out that it is not. So the
 * Video calls page has a button: it makes one meeting on the connected
 * account, an hour from now, with nobody invited, shows its link, and takes
 * it away again when asked. It is made with the same calls a booking's
 * meeting is made with (lib/meet-providers.ts), so what it proves is the
 * thing itself.
 *
 * One at a time for each account, and forgotten with the connection it was
 * made on (lib/meet-connect.ts, testKey): the meeting itself stays on the
 * creator's account until they delete it, here or there, like every meeting
 * we make.
