/**
 * Buying something for somebody else, as rules the browser can read too. The
 * part that keeps and delivers gifts is lib/gifts.ts.
 *
 * The buyer pays on Stripe's page as for anything else, and their receipt
 * says it was a gift and who it went to. The person they chose gets one
 * email: who it is from, their message, and a link to open it. From then on
 * it is theirs as if they had bought it — its download, its course, the
 * community it opens — on their own address, and the buyer does not get a
 * copy. A full refund takes it back.
 *
 * What can be given: a paid product bought once, that hands over a file, a
 * link, a course or a bundle. Not a membership or a payment plan (the
 * payments would be the buyer's for months), not a call (the time is the
 * buyer's to pick), not a price the buyer chooses or license keys.
 *
 * A product with price options can be given at any of them that hands
 * something over: the buyer picks which, pays that price, and that option is
 * what the recipient owns (its file or link, or the course at that option).
 * Not a private podcast sold at several prices: its feed is its buyer's own.
