/**
 * A product's picture, and how its card is laid out on the store page.
 *
 * The picture is shrunk in the creator's browser before it is sent — at most
 * 1600 pixels on its long side, as WebP or JPEG, and never more than a
 * megabyte — so what a visitor downloads is a few hundred kilobytes rather
 * than the twelve megabytes a phone camera writes. It goes straight from the
 * browser to the file store, the same private Blob store the products live
 * in, and is served from an address of ours that never changes for it, so
 * every browser and cache on the way may keep it for a year.
 *
 * The folder a store's pictures live in is its own, derived from the account
 * with a salt of its own. It is not the folder its paid files live in: a
 * picture is public, and its address must never tell anybody where the
 * things that are paid for are kept.
 *
 * Only JPEG and WebP are taken, and what a file is is decided by its first
 * bytes, not by what the upload says. Nothing that can carry a script — SVG
 * included — is ever served from here.
 *
 * The numbers live here, apart from the code that talks to the file store,
 * so the studio can read them in the browser.
