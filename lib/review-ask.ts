/**
 * The part of review requests a purchase needs: whether a store asks its
 * buyers for a review by email, how many days after buying, and putting a
 * paid order on the list to be asked.
 *
 * Kept apart from lib/review-requests.ts, which reads the list and sends the
 * email, so the store record and the purchase confirmation can use these
 * without importing the sender side, and the sender side can use the
 * confirmation without the two importing each other.
 *
 * Off for every store until its creator switches it on. Only orders paid
 * while it is on are put on the list, each once, whichever of the thanks
 * page and the five-minute job confirms the purchase first:
 *
 *   nl:rev:ask:due  -> sorted set of "<statsId>|<handle>|<reference>|<paidAt>",
 *                      scored by when the email is due, in seconds
