/**
 * The email a buyer gets after paying: what they bought, what it cost, and
 * how to get back to it.
 *
 * Stripe can send its own receipt from the creator's account, but only when
 * the creator switched that on in their Stripe settings, and it says nothing
 * about where the file is or how to open the course. So every paid checkout
 * on a creator's store gets this one, from the store's own name, once.
 *
 * Once is the whole difficulty. A buyer can land on the thanks page, refresh
 * it, open it again from their history, or never reach it at all because they
 * closed the tab while Stripe was redirecting. So the email is sent from both
 * places that learn about a payment — the thanks page, and a pass of the
 * five-minute job over each store's recent checkouts (lib/checkout-sweep.ts) —
 * and a key in Redis, taken before sending, decides which of them does it.
 * The sender is also handed an idempotency key, so a retry after a lost reply
 * cannot send it twice either.
 *
 * Nothing about the purchase is written down here beyond that key. What was
 * bought is read from the checkout on the creator's own Stripe account, which
 * is the record of it; the key only remembers that the email went out.
 *
 * Booked calls are left out: they have their own confirmation, with the time
 * and a calendar file, sent the moment the time is written down (lib/calls.ts).
 *
 * A product that hands out license keys has its key in the email too, given
 * to the sale here if the thanks page has not given it already
 * (lib/licence-keys.ts): the same key either way, because a sale only ever
 * gets one.
 *
 * An offer taken in one click after paying (lib/upsell.ts) is a payment of
 * its own, made after this email has usually gone, so it gets a short one of
 * its own (confirmOffer): what was added, what it cost, how to get it, and
 * its license key when it hands one out — kept under the offer's payment,
 * the same reference the thanks page and the list of purchases use.
