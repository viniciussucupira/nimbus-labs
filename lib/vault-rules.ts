/**
 * The file store that charges nothing for a download: the rules.
 *
 * A file a creator sells used to sit in the host's own file store, which
 * charges for every gigabyte that leaves it: five cents, and eleven for a
 * file too large to cache. A paid download is never refused (lib/delivery.ts),
 * so that was the one cost here with no ceiling, and inside the published
 * allowance alone it could take most of what the cheapest plan brings in.
 *
 * So the files that are sold live in a store that charges for keeping a file
 * and nothing for sending it (lib/vault.ts says which, and why). This file
 * holds what can be said without asking it anything, so the studio's browser
 * reads the same rules the server holds an upload to:
 *
 *   - where such a file is written down. A product, a price option, a lesson
 *     or an episode keeps one handle to a file, a path (lib/product-file.ts).
 *     A file in this store has a path of its own shape,
 *     `vault/<store's folder>/<what it hangs on>/<token>-<name>`, so
 *     everything that already carries a file carries this one, and the two
 *     stores are told apart by the path alone, as a lesson's video at the
 *     video service is (lib/stream-rules.ts);
 *   - how an upload is cut into pieces, and how large each one is.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network or a secret.

 * policy names every account's: the store answers nothing there without a
