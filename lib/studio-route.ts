/**
 * The checks every studio route makes before it does anything.
 *
 * They run in this order on purpose: a request from another site is turned
 * away before we look at the cookie, and the cookie is settled before any
 * network call goes out. Nothing reaches Stripe on behalf of someone who has
 * not proved they hold the session.
 *
 * Then two questions, answered here and nowhere else:
 *
 *   - Which store? A person can own up to five stores and help run others
 *     (lib/team.ts), so "the store for this session" is a choice. A studio
 *     page tells every request it makes which store it was drawn for — the
 *     x-nimbus-store header on a fetch (components/studio-store-pin.tsx),
 *     `?store=` on a form or a link — and that store is the one acted on, so
 *     two tabs open on two stores each keep editing their own. A request
 *     that names no store gets the one chosen last in the switcher (the
 *     nl_store cookie), and without that the person's own first store: for
 *     an account with one store, exactly what it always got.
 *
 *   - May they? Every route names the one permission it needs
 *     (lib/team-roles.ts), and the person's role on that store is read from
 *     the store's own records on every request. A store the request names
 *     that the person cannot open is refused outright, never swapped for
 *     another one, so nothing meant for one store can land in a different
 *     store.
 *
 * What someone on a team changes is written into the store's activity log
 * here too (lib/team.ts), so no route can forget to.
