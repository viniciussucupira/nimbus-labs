/**
 * Notices about content on a store, and taking it down (added 9 October 2026).
 *
 * Anybody can send a notice from /report: of copyright infringement, with
 * what 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) asks a notice to say, or of other illegal
 * content, as the EU's Digital Services Act asks. Each is kept, with a token
 * of its own, and sent to the support inbox with a link that opens it
 * (app/takedown/[token]). Whoever reads that inbox acts on it from there:
 * removes the link, unpublishes the product, takes the media kit down, or
 * switches the whole store's pages and sales off. Each step is written on
 * the store's record (`strikes`, the repeat-infringer record) and the creator
 * is emailed what was taken down, why, and how to send a counter-notice.
 *
 *   nl:report:<id>            JSON   the notice, 400 days
 *   nl:report:t:<sha(token)>  string its id, 60 days: the link stops working after that
 *
 * The person sending a notice is emailed nothing: a form anybody can fill in
 * must never be a way to send somebody an email. Nothing here is read on a
 * visit to any page.
