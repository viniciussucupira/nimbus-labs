/**
 * Connecting a creator's own Stripe account.
 *
 * The creator ends up owning a full Stripe account: their name on it, their
 * dashboard, their payouts, their money. Nimbus holds the account's identifier
 * and nothing else — no key to it, and never the money that lands in it. That
 * is what lets the site say the buyer pays into the creator's own account
 * without stretching the truth.
 *
 * Accounts v2, because Stripe now refuses v1 account creation for new Connect
 * integrations and points here. The shape below is not a style choice:
 *
 *   dashboard: "full"        the creator logs into Stripe itself
 *   fees_collector: stripe   Stripe bills them, not us
 *   losses_collector: stripe disputes and refunds are theirs, settled with Stripe
 *
 * Those three together are what Stripe calls a full-dashboard account, and it
 * is the only arrangement a platform registered in one country may open for a
 * creator in another. The platform-controlled variants — a dashboard we own,
 * fees and losses collected by us — are refused across a border. So the honest
 * design and the possible design are the same design here.
