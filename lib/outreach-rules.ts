/**
 * Outreach: a creator writes to a business that has never heard of them — a
 * brand that might sponsor them, somebody who might sell their product for a
 * share, a company that might buy it — and does it the way the law and
 * everybody's terms allow.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (October 5, 2026). Explee sells this outcome
 * to small businesses: it finds people in a database of 536 million, writes
 * each an email, sends it from mailboxes of its own and answers the replies,
 * for $0.04 an email. Its own terms leave the law to the customer, and its
 * reviews are about emails sent without approval and charges nobody agreed
 * to. Among stores for creators, Beacons writes a pitch and stops there; Stan
 * has nothing. PitchBrand, Bento and SponsorRadar sell brand outreach by
 * itself for $29 to $49 a month.
 *
 * What was read first, and what it decided:
 *
 *   The law. A first email from one business to another, with no earlier yes,
 *   is allowed with conditions in the United States (CAN-SPAM), the United
 *   Kingdom for companies (PECR reg. 22, ICO), France (CNIL), Ireland (S.I.
 *   336/2011 reg. 13), Sweden for companies (Marknadsföringslagen 19 §),
 *   Canada for an address the company published (CASL s. 10(9)(b)) and
 *   Australia likewise (Spam Act, Sch. 2 cl. 4). It needs consent first in
 *   Germany (UWG §7), the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Poland, businesses
 *   included. To a consumer it needs consent everywhere but the United
 *   States. So this is for businesses only, the creator says where the
 *   business is, and a country that is not on the first list cannot be
 *   written to from here — the ones not read yet included.
 *
 *   Everybody's terms. Our own email provider forbids "cold outreach,
 *   purchased lists, or scraped contact data", and so does every other one;
 *   mailboxes of ours would break Google's and Microsoft's rules. The bought
 *   databases forbid being shown to somebody else's customers. So nothing is
 *   sent by us and no contact is bought. The address is the one the business
 *   published on its own website, read from that website, kept with where it
 *   was found; and the email is opened, written, as a draft in the creator's
 *   own mailbox, where they read it and press Send themselves.
 *
 * Which also answers what Explee's customers complain of: nothing can go out
 * that the creator did not send, under their own name, and there is no
 * charge for an email at all.
 *
 * Nothing in this file touches the network, so the studio reads the same
 * rules in the browser that the server holds a pitch to.
