/**
 * A product's page, built from blocks: a sales page for something paid, or a
 * landing page that asks for an email address for something free.
 *
 * Every product already had a page of its own, with the long description
 * under its picture (lib/product-about.ts). This is the same page, laid out
 * by the creator: a hero, paragraphs, a list of what the buyer gets, what is
 * inside, who made it, questions and answers, a note on refunds, buttons
 * that lead to the checkout, and the buyers' own reviews (lib/reviews.ts).
 * A product without blocks keeps the page it has always had.
 *
 * Three rules make it something a buyer can trust, and they are kept here so
 * the studio's preview and the page itself apply the same ones:
 *
 *   - Nothing a creator types is ever read as markup. Every block is plain
 *     text with a fixed shape; paragraphs, "- " lists and written-out https
 *     addresses are the only formatting there is, drawn by the page itself
 *     (the same reading as the long description). A script, a style or a
 *     hidden element cannot be put on a page from here.
 *   - A video is one of three players, recognised from its address and
 *     rebuilt from its id — YouTube (on its privacy-enhanced address, which
 *     sets no cookie until the video plays), Vimeo (with do-not-track) and
 *     Loom. No other address becomes a frame, and the page loads none of
 *     them until the visitor presses play.
 *   - The terms are never the blocks'. A button in a block only leads to the
 *     checkout the page already has, with the price, options and plan the
 *     store page shows; a block cannot state a price of its own.
 *
 * The blocks live in a record of their own (lib/sales-page-store.ts), not in
 * the store's, which every visitor to the store page reads whole. Pure, so
 * the studio can import it.
