/**
 * Naming somebody: @handle, and the handle that makes it mean one person.
 *
 * Stan has no mentions at all. Circle, Skool, Mighty Networks and Kajabi all
 * do, and every one of them leans on a username, because a display name does
 * not identify anybody — two people called Ana Silva are two people, and an
 * @Ana Silva that quietly picks one of them is worse than no mention.
 *
 * So each member takes a handle when they choose their name: the name folded
 * to lower case and joined by hyphens, with a number on the end if somebody
 * already holds it. They see it on their own page, and it is what others
 * type. The creator is always @creator, which cannot be taken.
 *
 * Kept under the community's own id:
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:h        handle -> member key
 *
 * A handle is claimed and released together with the name it came from, and a
 * member who has not chosen a name has none, so there is nothing to type at
 * them and no notification they never asked for.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here: matching by display name as well, "did you
 * mean" guessing, and mentioning everybody at once. The first two make a
 * mention land on somebody who was not meant; the third is the feature that
 * turns a community's notifications into something people switch off.
