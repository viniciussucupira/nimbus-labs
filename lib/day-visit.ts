/**
 * A buyer's day on a store, counted as the visit it is.
 *
 * A store's public pages say they were opened themselves (components/
 * store-beacon.tsx). The pages a buyer comes back to do not: a course, a
 * lesson, the community. They are drawn for somebody the server already
 * knows, so the count is made here, on the server, as the page is drawn:
 * one visit for that address that day, the same one a public page of the
 * store would have counted (lib/traffic.ts), and so never a second one for
 * somebody who looked at the store's front page first.
 *
 * It is made after the page has been sent, so nobody waits on a count, and
 * it never throws. The creator is not counted: the callers leave them out.
 *
 * Only for a page. A route that answers a page's own questions (a like, a
 * message, the room asking what is new) is part of a visit and not another.
