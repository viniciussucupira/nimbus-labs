/**
 * The page coach: what a product's sales page has, what it is missing, and a
 * score out of 100 for how complete it is as a page that sells.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (8 October 2026): Kajabi, Hotmart Pages,
 * Stan, Gumroad and Teachable each give a creator blocks or templates and
 * then leave them alone with a blank page; none of them reads the page back
 * and says what is missing. The checks here are the parts every page that
 * sells well has in common — a headline about what the buyer gets, a picture
 * of the thing, a button before the reader has to scroll far, what is in it,
 * who it is for and who it is not, the questions buyers ask, a promise about
 * refunds — weighted by how much a buyer misses each one.
 *
 * A check is about what the page holds, never about how it is worded: the
 * words are the creator's, and the writing help (lib/ai.ts, reviewPage) is
 * where a second opinion on them comes from. Nothing here invents a claim;
 * a check that asks for proof asks for the real kind (verified reviews,
 * numbers the store counted), never for a testimonial typed in.
 *
 * Pure, so the studio's editor and the server ask the same function.
