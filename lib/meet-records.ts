/**
 * What was arranged on Google Calendar or Zoom for one call, written down.
 *
 * A creator who connected Google Calendar or Zoom (lib/meet-connect.ts) and
 * chose it for a call gets a meeting made on their own account for every
 * booking, or one per time for a group call or a dated session
 * (lib/meet-links.ts). Each meeting is one record here, found by its
 * "scope": the booking or the time it is for.
 *
 *   nl:meet:r:<scope>   the record below
 *   nl:meet:q           records with something left to do, by when it is due
 *
 * Scopes for calls:
 *
 *   c:<callsId>:b:<checkout session>        a one-to-one call
 *   c:<callsId>:t:<product>:<start>         a group call or a dated session
 *
 * Anything else that wants a meeting later (a community event, say) names
 * its own scope and goes through the same function in lib/meet-links.ts.
 *
 * The record says which link the people booked were given, and that is the
 * link every page, email, reminder and calendar file shows from then on
 * (lib/call-rooms.ts reads it first): the Meet or Zoom link when the meeting
 * was made, or — when it could not be, and the booking could not wait — the
 * creator's own link or a private video room. A link given is never changed
 * behind anybody's back: when a meeting that failed is made later by the
 * five-minute job, the people booked are emailed the new link
 * (lib/call-meetings.ts), and `updates` counts how often that happened, so
 * a calendar file sent afterward replaces the one sent before.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches the network, so the pages that only read a link
 * never wait on Google or Zoom.
