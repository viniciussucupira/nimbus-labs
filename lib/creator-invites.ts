/**
 * Creators inviting creators: the link, who came through it, and the ledger
 * of credit it has earned. The terms are in lib/creator-invite-rules.ts; the
 * daily job that reads Stripe and adds the credit is in
 * lib/creator-invite-credit.ts.
 *
 * How someone counts as invited, and why each rule is there:
 *
 *   - They pressed "Accept the invite" on the invite page, which leaves the
 *     code in a first-party cookie for INVITE_COOKIE_DAYS. Pressing it is
 *     asking for the invite's credit, so the cookie is the thing they asked
 *     for, not tracking — and nobody is counted for merely opening a link.
 *   - They then made their FIRST store. An account that already had one is
 *     not new to us, whoever's link it followed.
 *   - The invite is not their own: the inviting store's owner is someone
 *     else.
 *   - It is written once and never changed. The first invite accepted is the
 *     one that counts; nobody can take a creator over from whoever brought
 *     them.
 *
 * The daily job adds one more: an account that had already paid us before it
 * was invited — somebody who left and came back through a friend's link —
 * earns nobody anything.
 *
 * Kept:
 *
 *   nl:ref:code:<code>    the store (sid) whose link it is
 *   nl:ref:mycode:<sid>   that store's code
 *   nl:ref:by:<sid>       who invited this store, and when: { r, at, back? }
 *   nl:ref:list:<sid>     the stores this one invited, by when
 *   nl:ref:all            every invited store, by when (the job's walk)
 *   nl:ref:c:<id>         one credit: a share of an invoice, or a new
 *                         creator's first-payment credit
 *   nl:ref:mine:<sid>     the credits owed to this store, by when earned
 *   nl:ref:owed           credits earned and not yet on anyone's plan
