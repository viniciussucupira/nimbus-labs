/**
 * Amazon SES: the cheaper of the two services that send this site's email.
 *
 * Read before it was built (October 6, 2026): Amazon charges $0.10 for a
 * thousand emails (aws.amazon.com/ses/pricing), where the sender this site
 * started on charges $0.90 for a thousand past its plan
 * (resend.com/pricing). Nothing else that allows a creator's newsletter came
 * close: Mailgun, Postmark and MailerSend charge from $0.90 to $1.80, and
 * Cloudflare's service was reported at $0.35, in beta, and not for
 * newsletters.
 *
 * What the low price asks for in return, and where each part is answered:
 *
 *   - Amazon looks at every new account before letting it write to the
 *     public. Until then an account may send 200 emails a day, to addresses
 *     it has proved are its own. So nothing here is switched on by a
 *     setting: this file asks Amazon what the account may do (sesReady), and
 *     email goes through Amazon only once Amazon says it may. Before that,
 *     and whenever Amazon stops answering or pauses the account, everything
 *     goes through the first sender as it always did (lib/email.ts).
 *
 *   - Amazon expects the sender to look after its own bounces and spam
 *     reports, and reviews an account at 5% bounced or 0.1% reported
 *     (docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/faqs-enforcement.html). That is
 *     lib/mail-health.ts, which holds each store to 2% and 0.08%; Amazon
 *     tells us about each one through app/api/mail/ses.
 *
 *   - An account has a number of emails it may send in any 24 hours, and a
 *     number a second. Both are read from Amazon, never typed here, because
 *     Amazon raises them by itself as an account proves itself.
 *
 * Four settings, none of them a secret, and without all four Amazon is not
 * used at all:
 *
 *   AWS_SES_ROLE_ARN             the role at Amazon that may only send email
 *                                and read the account's own limits
 *   AWS_SES_REGION               where the account sends from: us-east-1
 *   AWS_SES_CONFIGURATION_SET    the set whose events go to the topic below
 *   AWS_SES_TOPIC_ARN            the one topic whose announcements are believed
 *
 * There is no key of Amazon's kept anywhere. The host gives every request
 * here a short-lived token that says, signed, which project of which team is
 * running (vercel.com/docs/oidc, read October 6, 2026). Amazon is told once
 * to trust that token for this one project's production, and lends a key
 * for an hour in exchange for it (sesCredentials, below). Nothing that could
 * be copied out of a settings page and used from somewhere else exists.
 *
 * A long-lived key still works in the role's place, for a host that has no
 * such token: AWS_SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. The role
 * is used when both are set.
 *
 *   nl:ses:state            what Amazon last said the account may do (JSON)
 *   nl:ses:h:<YYYY-MM-DDTHH> emails Amazon took in that hour
 *   nl:ses:did:<hash>       an email of a batch Amazon already took
