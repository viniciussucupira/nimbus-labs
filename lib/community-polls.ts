/**
 * A poll on a post: a question with answers people pick from.
 *
 * What the others do, checked on 30 September 2026, because "better" has to
 * mean something measurable:
 *
 *   Circle    5 options, one answer only, an end date, results the creator
 *             can keep to themselves, and who voted for what is visible.
 *   Kajabi    10 options, multiple answers allowed, an end date, and results
 *             a member sees only once they have voted.
 *   Discord   10 answers, a fixed duration from a list, multiple choice, and
 *             results always public.
 *   Stan      none. Its own help centre tells creators to write a post and
 *             agree that one emoji reaction means A and another means B.
 *
 * So: 12 options, multiple answers when the creator wants them, an end date
 * or none, and results the creator can hold back until it closes. Two things
 * here that none of the four do — a voter can take their vote back entirely,
 * not only change it, and a poll says plainly whether the creator can see who
 * voted for what, instead of leaving people to assume.
 *
 * On privacy, the decision worth stating: a vote is never anonymous to the
 * software, because a poll that let one person vote a thousand times is not a
 * poll — the count has to be tied to the voter to be worth reading. What the
 * creator is shown is the tally only, never the list of who chose what. The
 * page says so, in those words, so nobody votes believing something untrue
 * about who can see it.
 *
 * How it is kept, under the community's own id:
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:pv:<post>   who voted what: member key -> option ids, comma separated
 *   nl:cm:<id>:pc:<post>   the tally: option id -> how many
 *
 * The tally is kept as its own small hash rather than counted from the votes,
 * because counting 50,000 votes to draw one bar is work nobody should pay for
 * on every page view. The two are written together, and a vote that changes
 * moves the count off the old option and on to the new one in the same call.
