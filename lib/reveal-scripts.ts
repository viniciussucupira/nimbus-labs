/**
 * The two plain scripts the root layout writes into every page (app/layout.tsx):
 * the switch that lets `.reveal` sections start hidden, and the observer that
 * brings them into view. Why they are plain scripts and not React is written
 * there.
 *
 * They are kept here, apart, because the pages rendered per visit run only
 * scripts the browser is told it may (lib/csp.ts): Next puts the nonce on its
 * own scripts, but these two are written by the layout, which is shared with
 * the pages built ahead of time and so has no nonce to give them. They are
 * allowed instead by their SHA-256 hashes, which work beside a nonce and
 * 'strict-dynamic'. Change a single character of either and its hash must
 * change with it — tests/reveal-scripts.test.ts checks the two agree, so a
 * page never silently loses its animation to the policy again.
