/**
 * A member's phone, told when something happened to them.
 *
 * Stan's own help centre says "All Community notifications are sent via
 * email!", and offers daily, weekly or never. Circle, Skool, Mighty Networks,
 * Whop, Kajabi and Discord all send push. The research put this second of the
 * six capabilities, behind search, and the reason is plain: a paid community
 * does not die of dissatisfaction, it dies of being forgotten.
 *
 * Everything hard is already written. lib/web-push.ts derives our VAPID keys
 * from the deployment's own secret, signs the requests, encrypts the payload
 * and refuses to post to anything that is not a known push service;
 * lib/phone-alerts.ts uses it for the creator's own phone. This file is the
 * same thing for the people on the other side of the community, and adds no
 * key, no dependency and no second way of doing it.
 *
 * Kept under the community's own id:
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ps:<who>   endpoint -> the device, as JSON
 *
 * One person, several devices, each its own row, each going on its own when
 * its browser says it has gone.
 *
 * What is sent is deliberately thin: who did what, and where to go. Never the
 * words anybody wrote. A notification is read on a lock screen, over a
 * shoulder, on a device that may be borrowed — and a community that promises
 * private messages cannot put their contents there.
 *
 * Two limits, said here and said on the page, because a notification somebody
 * believes in and does not get is worse than one they never expected:
 *
 *   - On iPhone and iPad a web page may only send push once it has been added
 *     to the home screen. Apple requires that, not us.
 *   - A browser may drop a subscription whenever it likes. The push service
 *     then answers 404 or 410, which is not an error to retry: that device is
 *     gone, and its row goes with it.
