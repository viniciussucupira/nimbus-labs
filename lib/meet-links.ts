/**
 * A Google Meet or Zoom meeting for each booking, made on the creator's own
 * account, and kept in step when the booking moves or is refunded.
 *
 * The creator connects Google Calendar or Zoom in the studio
 * (lib/meet-connect.ts) and picks it as where a call happens
 * (CallSetup.meet). From then on:
 *
 *   - a one-to-one call gets its own meeting when it is confirmed: a Google
 *     Calendar event on the creator's primary calendar with a Meet link and
 *     the buyer on the guest list, or a scheduled Zoom meeting;
 *   - a group call or a dated session gets one meeting per time, made when
 *     its first seat is confirmed; on Google every buyer after that is added
 *     to the same event's guest list (up to MAX_GUESTS; the rest join by the
 *     link like anybody else), and buyers never see each other's addresses;
 *   - a one-to-one booking its buyer moves has its event or meeting moved
 *     to the new time, keeping its link; a seat moved to another time of a
 *     group leaves the old time's guest list and joins the new time's;
 *   - a booking refunded in full has its one-to-one event or meeting
 *     deleted, or its buyer taken off the group's guest list
 *     (lib/call-meetings.ts reads the refunds).
 *
 * Google is told to email nobody (sendUpdates=none): the buyer's
 * confirmation, reminders and calendar files come from us, as for every
 * other call, with the Meet or Zoom link in them, so nobody gets the same
 * news twice.
 *
 * A failure never holds a booking up. When the meeting cannot be made — the
 * provider did not answer, the connection was withdrawn, the account has
 * Meet switched off — the booking is given what the call falls back to (the
 * creator's own link, or a private video room when they have none,
 * lib/call-rooms.ts), the problem is written down for the studio, and the
 * five-minute job tries again after 5, 15, 60, 180 and 720 minutes. If a
 * try succeeds more than SWITCH_BEFORE_MS before the call, the people booked
 * are emailed the new link (at most MAX_TELL of them; a bigger group keeps
 * the link it has); closer to the call, nobody's link changes. A move or a
 * removal that fails is retried the same way.
 *
 * `meetingFor` is the one function anything else that needs a meeting —
 * a community event, later — calls, with a scope of its own.
