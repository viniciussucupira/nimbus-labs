/**
 * How many times each product was bought, for a store that chose to say so
 * (StoreLook.sold, switched on under Look).
 *
 * Measured before it was built (7 October 2026): Gumroad shows "N sales" on a
 * product's page when the creator allows it, and Udemy, Teachable and Kajabi
 * course pages show a count of students. Stan's cards show none. A number a
 * buyer can trust moves a buyer; a number anybody could type moves them once
 * and then never again, which is why this one is never typed:
 *
 *   - It is read from the creator's own Stripe account (lib/stats.ts,
 *     readAllTimeSales): paid checkouts of this store and one-click extras,
 *     counted per product. Nothing is entered, adjusted or rounded up.
 *   - It is kept a few hours, so a busy page asks Stripe nothing, and read
 *     again in the background once older than that. A page with nothing
 *     kept yet shows no number rather than a guess, and asks for one.
 *   - It is only said once there are at least SHOWN_FROM, because "bought 2
 *     times" tells a visitor something the creator did not mean to say.
 *   - "Bought N times" is the claim, which is exactly what was counted: a
 *     sale later refunded was still bought, and nothing here says "students",
 *     "happy customers" or anything else the count does not measure.
