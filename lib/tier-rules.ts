/**
 * Membership tiers: memberships a member can switch between, up or down,
 * from their own membership page, as rules the browser can read too. The
 * switch itself is in lib/tier-switch.ts.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Stan's help center says
 * existing members stay at the price they bought at (article 132) and has no
 * way for a member to move from one membership to another.
 *
 * What a membership hands over is read, at every door, from the product its
 * subscription is on NOW, not the one it was bought as:
 *
 *   1. the price on the subscription, when it is a price made for a switch:
 *      that price names its product in its own metadata, so the price the
 *      member pays and what they get change in the same instant;
 *   2. the subscription's own `product`, rewritten after a switch;
 *   3. the checkout's `product`, for every membership never switched.
