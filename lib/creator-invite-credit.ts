/**
 * Turning invited creators' payments into credit on a plan, once a day.
 *
 * This app receives no events from Stripe, so it asks, the way every other
 * sweep here does (app/api/cron/plans). Two steps:
 *
 *   1. Earn. For every invited store, the paid invoices of the customer it
 *      pays us from are read. Each one paid at least INVITE_HOLD_DAYS ago —
 *      past the window in which our Refund Policy gives the money back — earns
 *      whoever invited it INVITE_SHARE_PERCENT of what was actually paid,
 *      less anything refunded or credited back. The first one that earns
 *      also earns the invited creator INVITE_BONUS_CENTS on their own plan.
 *      An account that had paid us before it was invited earns nothing: it
 *      was not brought to us.
 *   2. Put on the plan. Every credit earned and not yet at Stripe becomes a
 *      credit on the customer balance of the store it is for — Stripe's own
 *      account credit, which it takes off that customer's next invoices on
 *      its own, until it is used up. A store that has not started paying us
 *      yet keeps its credit here until it does.
 *
 * Nothing is ever credited twice. An invoice is written down here the moment
 * it is read, with SET NX. And before a credit is sent to Stripe, the
 * customer's balance history is read for one already carrying that credit's
 * id, so even a credit that reached Stripe and then failed to be written
 * down here is found and not sent again. The request itself carries the
 * credit's id as its idempotency key as well.
 *
 * Checked against Stripe's API reference (30 September 2026): a negative
 * `amount` on /v1/customers/{id}/balance_transactions is a credit; it applies
 * to the customer's next finalized invoices; an invoice's paid amount already
 * leaves out any credit used on it, so credit is never earned on credit;
 * an invoice's subscription and payments sit under `parent` and `payments`
 * from 2025 on, which is why the version is pinned here.
