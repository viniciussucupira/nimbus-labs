/**
 * Outreach, on the server (lib/outreach-rules.ts has the rules and why):
 * reading a business's own website for the address it published, keeping
 * each pitch with the proof of where its address was found, and holding
 * every one to the rules before a word of it is written.
 *
 * What is read of somebody else's site is as little as answers the question:
 * its robots.txt, its front page, and at most three pages its own menu calls
 * contact, partners, press or about — each once, by a reader that says who it
 * is, through the same guarded fetch as every address a creator types
 * (lib/safe-fetch.ts). Nothing is read that robots.txt asks readers to leave
 * alone, nothing behind a login, and nothing is kept but the addresses at
 * the business's own domain with the words around them.
 *
 * What is never done here: sending. A pitch is a draft the creator opens in
 * their own mailbox.
 *
 *   nl:outreach:<statsId>:pitches       each pitch, by id (a hash)
 *   nl:outreach:<statsId>:stop          the domains that asked this store to stop (a set)
 *   nl:outreach:<statsId>:me            who is writing: the name and postal address on every pitch
 *   nl:outreach:<statsId>:day:<date>    pitches written that day
 *   nl:outreach:stoplink:<key>          the pitch a stop link in a footer belongs to
 *   nl:outreach:stop:all                the domains that asked that no store here write to them (a set)
