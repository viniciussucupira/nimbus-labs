/**
 * The creator's media kit (added 9 October 2026): one page at
 * /@handle/media-kit a brand reads before paying for a sponsored post — who
 * the creator is, how many people follow them where, who those people are,
 * what a collaboration costs and who they have worked with — with a way to
 * get in touch and a copy to save as a PDF.
 *
 * Beacons sells it as the reason creators pay for its plan; most stores have
 * nothing like it, so a creator keeps one in a design tool and sends it out
 * of date. Here it sits beside the store, in the store's look and language.
 *
 * Honest by construction. The follower numbers are the creator's own, typed
 * in the studio — nothing here can read them from the networks — so the page
 * says they are, and the date they were last changed (`stated`, set by the
 * server whenever a number changes). What the page says on its own account
 * is only what this site counted: the products listed and the buyers'
 * reviews. Brands are names in plain text, never logos.
 *
 * Kept on the store's record, so the page reads nothing else. Browser-safe.
