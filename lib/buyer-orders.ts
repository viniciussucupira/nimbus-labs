/**
 * A buyer getting back what they bought, at any time, without an account.
 *
 * The link on the thanks page works for three days, which is what stops a
 * leaked link from becoming a free copy for everyone. The cost of that is a
 * buyer who closes the tab, changes phone or comes back a month later and no
 * longer has what they paid for — and who blames the creator, not us.
 *
 * So the buyer types the address they paid with, and we email that address a
 * link to a page that lists everything it bought from this store, each with
 * its download or its link. Only whoever reads that inbox gets in, which is
 * the protection an account gives, without a password to invent or for us to
 * keep.
 *
 * Nothing is written down about purchases here. The list is asked of the
 * creator's own Stripe account every time, which is the record of who paid
 * for what; a refunded sale is left off, because Stripe says so, not because
 * we remembered. A membership that stopped stays on the list with nothing to
 * open and the way to renew, so its former member is told what happened
 * rather than finding it quietly gone (lib/membership-access.ts).
 *
 * Like cancelling a membership, this works whatever state the creator's own
 * Marktmorgen subscription is in: somebody paid for that file, and they get it.
