/**
 * Whether Marktmorgen is open.
 *
 * Open means one thing: a creator can start a paid plan, which is the only
 * moment we take a card. While it is not, the site is a preview of something
 * still being built, and it says so on every public page instead of leaving
 * a visitor to work it out from a list: a store can be opened and set up, and
 * no plan can be started (app/api/billing/checkout/route.ts refuses, and the
 * studio shows no button that would be refused).
 *
 * A store that already pays is left exactly as it is: changing, canceling
 * and keeping a subscription do not read this.
 *
 * One constant, in a file that imports nothing, so the server and the menu
 * in the browser read the same answer. Opening is changing it to `true`.
