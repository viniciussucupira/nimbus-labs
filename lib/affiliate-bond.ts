/**
 * The affiliate a buyer belongs to, for as long as the programme runs.
 *
 * Why this is not another cookie. Hotmart's affiliate settings offer a cookie
 * that lasts "for ever", and no such thing can be delivered by anybody: Chrome
 * caps the Expires and Max-Age of every cookie at 400 days, silently, whatever
 * a site asks for — it does not refuse the cookie, it shortens it and says
 * nothing (shipped in Chrome 104, August 2022). And long before that limit the
 * cookie is gone anyway, because it lives in one browser: clearing the browser
 * ends it, a new phone never had it, the work laptop is a different visitor,
 * and a private window starts empty. A window measured in days is the best a
 * cookie can honestly promise, which is why ours stops at 365.
 *
 * So the thing that actually lasts is not kept in the browser at all. Once a
 * sale has been credited to an affiliate — by a click, or by the code the buyer
 * typed — the creator may choose to have that buyer stay theirs: every later
 * purchase by the same person earns the same affiliate, with no cookie
 * anywhere. That survives a cleared browser, a different device, a private
 * window, 400 days and five years, because what is remembered is the buyer,
 * not the visit.
 *
 * It is off until a creator switches it on, and that is deliberate. It changes
 * who gets paid for a sale that nobody's link brought in, and only the creator
 * can decide whether the affiliate who found a customer should keep earning on
 * them. A programme already running is not quietly re-pointed.
 *
 * What is stored about the buyer is their address put through SHA-256 with the
 * store's own id, and nothing else — no name, no order, no list of what they
 * bought. The hash cannot be read back into an address, so the record answers
 * only the one question it exists for: an address arrives with a sale, and the
 * record says which affiliate, if any, that person already belongs to. It is
 * never shown to the affiliate, who sees counts and commissions as before.
