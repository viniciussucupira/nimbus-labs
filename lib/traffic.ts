/**
 * How many visits a store had this month.
 *
 * lib/traffic-rules.ts says what a visit is and why it is the measure a
 * plan covers and a bill is made from. This file keeps it.
 *
 *   nl:traffic:day:<folder>:<day>    who came that day, each once
 *   nl:traffic:n:<folder>:<month>    visits, added up, that month
 *   nl:traffic:x:<folder>:<month>    the live room, in hundredths of a visit
 *   nl:traffic:folders:<month>       the stores that had any, that month
 *
 * A page of a store says it was opened (app/api/store/hit). The visitor is
 * reduced to a few letters made from the day, the store and the address
 * they came from (visitorAddress), and put in the day's set. The set
 * answers whether they were already in it; only somebody new to the day
 * adds a visit to the month. The letters are made with a key of our own and
 * cannot be turned back into an address, and the set is gone two days
 * later: what is kept is a count.
 *
 * Counted exactly, by a set and not by an estimate, because a bill is made
 * from it.
 *
 * What this errs toward. Everybody behind one address, a household or an
 * office, is one visit a day. A count that cannot be written is not made.
 * A robot that says it is one, and the store's owner, are never counted
 * (lib/visit.ts). Every one of those is in the creator's favor, which is
 * the way round a figure that is billed from has to err.
