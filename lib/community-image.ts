/**
 * The one picture a community post may carry.
 *
 * It travels exactly as a product picture does (lib/product-image.ts): shrunk
 * in the member's browser to at most 1600 pixels on its long side and one
 * megabyte, sent straight to the private file store through a door that
 * names the one path it may write, and checked by its first bytes before any
 * post points at it. Only JPEG and WebP are kept; nothing that can carry a
 * script, SVG included, is ever accepted.
 *
 * Unlike a product picture it is not public. It is served through a route
 * that asks, on every request, whether the browser asking may read the
 * community (app/api/store/community/image), and it tells browsers to keep
 * it privately rather than in any shared cache.
 *
 * Each community's pictures live in a folder of their own, named from the
 * community's id with a salt of its own, so the folder of one community says
 * nothing about another's, or about where a store's paid files are kept.
