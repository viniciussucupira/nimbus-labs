/**
 * Two things a creator can add to a one-off product, and the rules for each.
 *
 * An order bump: another of their products, offered at a price of their own
 * choosing in a box the buyer can tick before paying. The box is never ticked
 * for them — an extra charge the buyer did not choose is not a sale, and in
 * Europe it is not allowed either. Up to three per product (MAX_BUMPS), each
 * its own box, each ticked or not on its own.
 *
 * A limited quantity: the product stops selling once that many have been
 * paid for. The number the page shows is the real one, counted from real
 * checkouts, because scarcity that is not true is a lie told to a buyer.
 *
 * A funnel of one-click offers after paying (lib/funnel.ts): each offer is
 * another product, and one press adds it, charged to the card the buyer just
 * used. The same rules apply to what can be offered as to a bump.
 *
 * A payment plan: the same product, paid in a fixed number of weekly or
 * monthly payments instead of at once, delivered after the first. It ends
 * by itself after the last payment.
 *
 * Pure, so the studio and the server apply the same rules.
