/**
 * One product, several prices.
 *
 * A week of meal plans for $27 and five weeks for $39. The same photo pack
 * personal or commercial. A membership at three levels. In each case it is one
 * thing the buyer already wants, offered at the size that fits them, and the
 * creator writes one product card instead of three that compete with each
 * other on their own page.
 *
 * Stan's help centre lists this among its most requested features and says
 * there is no native way to do it. That is the whole reason it is here.
 *
 * Two rules hold the shape of it:
 *
 *   The price is never sent by the buyer. The form posts an option id, the
 *   server finds that option on the stored product, and the amount charged is
 *   the one the creator saved. A page that posted the price would be a page
 *   where anybody can buy anything for a cent.
 *
 *   Each option delivers its own thing. A five-week plan that hands over the
 *   one-week file is a refund and an apology, so an option carries its own
 *   file or its own link, exactly as a product without options does. An option
 *   with neither is not offered to a buyer at all.
 *
 * A product with no options is not a special case in disguise: it is the
 * normal one, with its own single price and its own delivery, and every store
 * written before this existed simply has none.

 * as they want, and the number is set by what the records can honestly carry

 *
 * It is a number, not the word "unlimited", for the same reason the product

 * weigh 256 KB, and fifty options at their heaviest — a long link, a file and
 * a full list of what each includes — come to about 60 KB of it. Past a

 * product's options inside the one record that holds the whole store, and that
 * record may weigh a megabyte. The index drops an id it does not recognise
 * when it reads one back, so an option whose id did not match this used to be
 * written into the record and then silently vanish from the index — and the
 * size of the index, which is what decides how many products a store may
 * really hold, rested on nothing but the convention that ids come from
 * freshId. Refusing the id here makes the two ends agree, and makes that size
 * a thing the code enforces rather than a thing it assumes.
 *
 * Twenty-four: more than twice the ten characters freshId makes, twice its
 * twelve-character fallback, and well inside the forty the option route
 * already truncates an incoming id to — so nothing that works today is
 * refused, and an id longer than this is one the studio could not edit, move
 * or remove anyway.
 *
 * The number is chosen on what it leaves spare, not on what looks generous.
 * At twenty-four, a store at the published ceiling spends about 230 KB of the
 * record on its index and keeps some 400 KB — two fifths of the record — for
 * everything else about the store. At forty it keeps 272 KB, which clears the
 * floor by two percent and would make the published ceiling depend on nothing
 * else about a store ever growing. tests/catalog-ceiling.test.ts does that
 * arithmetic on every run, from these bounds rather than from a comment.
