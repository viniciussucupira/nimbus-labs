/**
 * The emails and the phone notification around a community's live events
 * (lib/community-events.ts), sent by the five-minute mail job.
 *
 *   - Reminders, a day and an hour before, to the members who said they are
 *     coming AND asked to be emailed by the community (the "Email me" box on
 *     their You page, which starts empty). Each carries the same one-click
 *     way to stop as the community's announcements (lib/community-mail.ts):
 *     one switch for the community's emails, which leaves the member in the
 *     community and keeps their places.
 *   - One email when the creator moves an event and one when they cancel it,
 *     to everyone who said they are coming, whether or not they asked for
 *     the community's emails: they planned their day around it. Each move is
 *     its own email, sent once however often the page is pressed or the job
 *     retried; a cancellation is sent once.
 *   - A notification on the creator's phone fifteen minutes before, to open
 *     the room first (lib/phone-alerts.ts, "live").
 *
 * Nothing in the queue is trusted beyond "look at this event now". The event
 * is read again when its moment comes: a reminder planned for a start the
 * event has since moved away from, or for an event since cancelled, is
 * dropped; and who gets it is decided batch by batch as it goes out — still
 * coming, not taken out, and, for a reminder, still let into the community
 * and the event (lib/community-access.ts), so a member whose membership
 * lapsed is not reminded of an event they can no longer open. The emails
 * never carry the way in: they point at the event's page, which shows it
 * from fifteen minutes before, to whoever may come.
 *
 * Each send is written down when it starts, its readers in a list, and goes
 * out a hundred at a time, each batch with its own key so a retry never sends
 * twice; the key a send is made under says which reminder, move or
 * cancellation it is, so the same one is never started twice.
 *
 * These are the community's own notices about something a member signed up
 * for, sent from the store's name through Nimbus's address like the reminders
 * before a booked call, on every plan, and not counted against Pro's monthly
 * emails.
 *
 *   nl:cm:evq                  what is due, by when (lib/community-events.ts plans it)
 *   nl:cm:evmail:<job>         one send (JSON)
 *   nl:cm:evmail:<job>:to      its readers, as member keys, in order (a list)
 *   nl:cm:evmail:<job>:made    written once, so the same send is never started twice
 *   nl:cm:evmailq              sends under way
