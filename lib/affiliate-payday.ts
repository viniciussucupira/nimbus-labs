/**
 * The email a creator gets on the day they said they pay their affiliates.
 *
 * The promise a creator makes on their affiliate page — "paid on the 5th of
 * each month" — is only worth what it is kept at, and the way a promise like
 * that gets broken is never bad faith. It is a person with a store to run
 * forgetting which day it is. So Marktmorgen keeps the date instead: on the morning
 * of that day, if anybody is owed something that has cleared, the creator gets
 * one message saying how much and to how many, with the link that opens the
 * batch.
 *
 * Nothing here moves money, and nothing here can. It reads the book, counts
 * what is payable, and writes an email. The creator still downloads the file
 * and pays it from their own account, which is the whole architecture and does
 * not bend for convenience.
 *
 * Sent once per store per month: the day's key is claimed in Redis before the
 * message goes out, so a second run of the job on the same day — a retry, an
 * overlap, a store seen twice while it moves between addresses — finds the day
 * taken and does nothing.
