/**
 * The terms of inviting another creator to Marktmorgen, in one place.
 *
 * Read by the job that adds the credit, by the studio page that shows it, by
 * the invite page a new creator lands on, and by the public pages and the
 * Terms. Nothing here reads a secret or talks to anything, so a client
 * component and a marketing page can import the real numbers rather than
 * retyping them.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026), what the others pay a
 * creator who brings them another creator:
 *
 *   - Stan: 20% of each payment, for as long as that creator stays
 *     subscribed, paid in cash; its help center names nothing for the new
 *     creator.
 *   - Skool: 40% of the subscription, in cash, held 14 days.
 *   - Beacons: 25% of the monthly profit, and the new creator gets $20 of
 *     credit.
 *   - Circle: $100 and up to 20% recurring. Kajabi: tiered, up to 20%.
 *     Gumroad: nothing.
 *
 * Here it is half of every payment, for as long as they pay, and the new
 * creator gets a whole month of the plan back after their first payment. It
 * is paid as credit on the inviting creator's own Marktmorgen plan, and that
 * is said everywhere it is offered: two creators who stay pay for the plan of
 * whoever brought them, and credit beyond that stays on the account for the
 * months after. It is credit rather than cash because credit is what reaches
 * a creator in any country, the same day, with no payout account to set up —
 * and a program is only offered in the form it is actually paid.

 * payment that is given back. It is written as the sum rather than as a
 * number so that lengthening the refund window cannot quietly start paying
 * credit on refundable payments — which is exactly what happened the day
 * the window went from fourteen days to thirty and this said 21.
