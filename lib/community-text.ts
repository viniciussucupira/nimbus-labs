/**
 * The words people write in a store's community, and every limit on them.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network or Redis, so the studio and the composer
 * in the browser read the very numbers the server enforces, and a limit can
 * never be one thing on the page and another in the code.
 *
 * What a member writes is plain text and stays plain text. It is never put
 * into a page as HTML: React writes it as text, so a "<script>" typed into a
 * post is shown as those eight characters and does nothing. The one thing
 * turned into something else is a web address. `segments` cuts a text into
 * words and addresses, and an address becomes a link only when it is an
 * ordinary http or https address — never javascript:, data: or anything a
 * browser would run — and the link is marked as the member's, not ours
 * (rel="nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer"), and opens in a new tab.
 *
 * Every number below is published to the creator in the studio. They are
 * generous for a real community and tight for a script: a person does not
 * write six posts in an hour, and a spammer who can is stopped at five.
