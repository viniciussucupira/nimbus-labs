/**
 * The one-click offers after paying: each press adds another product,
 * charged to the card the buyer just used, on the creator's own account.
 *
 * A product's funnel (lib/funnel.ts) decides what is offered and in what
 * order; this file is what happens when the buyer answers. What keeps it
 * honest and safe is the same for the first offer as for the fifth:
 *
 *   - the card is saved only for payments made while the buyer is there
 *     (setup_future_usage "on_session"), never to be charged behind their back;
 *   - only a card is asked to be saved, so the checkout still offers every
 *     other way to pay; a buyer who paid with one that cannot be charged again
 *     in one click (Klarna, iDEAL and the like) meets no offer at all
 *     (lib/instant-pay.ts, reusableMethod);
 *   - each offer is charged in the currency of the order it follows, which
 *     is the store's; an order in another currency, from before the store
 *     changed it, is followed by no offer;
 *   - the offers only work in the browser that paid: a secret cookie is set
 *     when the checkout opens and its fingerprint travels with the charge, so
 *     a thanks-page link that is forwarded cannot be used to charge the card;
 *   - they are open for an hour after paying, and each can be answered once,
 *     yes or no, guarded so a double press charges once;
 *   - only the offer the buyer is actually at can be answered: the answers
 *     already given are walked again on the server, so no offer is skipped to
 *     and none is taken twice;
 *   - when the bank asks the buyer to confirm, they are sent to confirm it,
 *     nothing is delivered until Stripe says it is paid, and nothing more is
 *     offered until it has;
 *   - when the answer from Stripe is lost on the way back, the charge is not
 *     guessed at: it is found again among the buyer's payments and settled
 *     from what Stripe says happened;
 *   - a card that turns an offer down is not asked again: nothing more is
 *     offered after a decline.
 *
 * Each offer paid is its own payment, with its own reference (the payment's
 * id): its licence key, its stamped copy and its line on the buyer's list of
 * purchases are all kept under it, and the buyer gets a short confirmation
 * for it (lib/purchase-email.ts, confirmOffer), with the key in it.
 *
 * An offer still waiting on an answer — the bank asked the buyer to confirm,
 * or Stripe's answer was lost on the way back — is also kept in a list the
 * five-minute job walks (settlePendingOffers), so its confirmation email and
 * the affiliate's credit follow Stripe's answer within minutes, whether or
 * not the buyer ever comes back to the thanks page.
