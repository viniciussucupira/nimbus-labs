/**
 * Fetching an address a creator typed, without letting it reach inside.
 *
 * Two features send requests to addresses a creator gives us: the calendars
 * read for busy times (lib/calendar-sync.ts) and the webhooks sent when
 * something happens in a store (lib/webhooks.ts). Two more go through here
 * although their hosts are fixed lists of our own choosing: the email
 * platforms a creator connects (lib/email-platforms.ts) and the push
 * services a phone subscribed through (lib/web-push.ts), because the address
 * of a push subscription is written by a browser, which a person controls.
 * An address typed into a
 * form is an address anybody could have typed, and a server that fetches it
 * without looking is a server that can be asked to fetch its own insides —
 * a cloud's metadata service, a database on the private network, a port on
 * the same machine. So every request made here passes the same checks:
 *
 *   - https only, on port 443 or a port above 1023, with no user name or
 *     password in the address, and a name that looks like a public one;
 *   - the name is looked up here, every address it has is checked, and the
 *     request is made to the address that was checked, not to a second
 *     lookup that could answer differently. An address in any private,
 *     loopback, link-local, shared, documentation or multicast range, v4 or
 *     v6 (including v4 dressed as v6), is refused, and so is a name with
 *     even one such address among its answers;
 *   - a redirect is a new address and passes the same checks, at most three
 *     times; a POST never follows one;
 *   - the whole exchange has a deadline, and the answer a size cap, counted
 *     as it arrives rather than trusted from the header.
 *
 * Nothing here is a dependency: Node's own https, with the connection pinned
 * to the address that was checked.
