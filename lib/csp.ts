/**
 * What a page of ours may load, run and send, as a Content-Security-Policy.
 *
 * Two policies, because the site is served two ways:
 *
 *   - The pages that are rendered for each visit — every store page, on
 *     marktmorgen.com and on a creator's own domain, the studio, signing in
 *     and unsubscribing — get a fresh random nonce per response (proxy.ts)
 *     and run only the scripts that carry it, plus what those scripts load
 *     themselves ('strict-dynamic'). That is the strict kind: text a creator
 *     or a buyer typed can never become a script on these pages, whatever
 *     slips through the escaping, because it would not carry the nonce. The
 *     creator's own ad pixels are started by our code, so they load under the
 *     same rule, and only the addresses those four platforms send their
 *     measurements to are added to what a page may connect to. The three
 *     video players a product's page may show (lib/sales-page.ts) are the
 *     only other addresses such a page may put in a frame, and only their
 *     embed hosts — YouTube's privacy-enhanced one, Vimeo's player and
 *     Loom's embed — never the sites themselves. A lesson's own video, when
 *     the video service keeps it (lib/stream.ts), plays in that service's
 *     player, which is the fourth, and the service's address is the one
 *     place besides the file store the studio sends a file to. The lists
 *     of pixels and players are given to a
 *     store's own pages only; the studio, signing in and unsubscribing get
 *     neither. One page more may frame one address more: a community live
 *     event's own page (/@<handle>/community/events/<event>) may show its
 *     private video room from meet.jit.si (lib/community-events.ts), and is
 *     the only page allowed the camera, the microphone and sharing a screen,
 *     for that frame alone (roomPermissions, below).
 *
 *   - The pages built once, ahead of time — the home page, the help, the
 *     blog, the comparison pages — have no request to make a nonce for, so
 *     Next's own inline scripts are allowed by 'unsafe-inline'. Nothing on
 *     those pages comes from a creator or a visitor, and everything else is
 *     held to this site alone: no script from another address, no connection
 *     to another address, no plug-ins, no <base>, forms only to this site or
 *     an https address.
 *
 * Both let a page be framed only by this site ('self'), because the home page
 * shows the demo store in a frame of its own. One kind of page is the
 * exception: the card a creator pastes into their own website
 * (/embed/<handle>/<product>, lib/embed-rules.ts), which exists to be framed
 * by any site. Framing is safe there because nothing on it acts for anybody:
 * it reads no session, sets no cookie, and its one button opens Stripe's
 * checkout in a new tab, where the buyer still types their card and presses
 * pay themselves. A site that hid it under something else could at most
 * open a checkout nobody pays. Files handed over by the API
 * carry their own, stricter policy (lib/request-guard.ts, fileHeaders).
 *
 * Deliberately left out: 'upgrade-insecure-requests', which would break the
 * site on a local http address and adds nothing to a site that only answers
 * on https and says so with Strict-Transport-Security.
