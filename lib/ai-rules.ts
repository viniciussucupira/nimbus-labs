/**
 * The writing help in the studio, as rules the browser can read too: what it
 * writes, how much of it a store gets each month, and what it will never do.
 * The part that talks to the model is lib/ai.ts, which only the server loads.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Circle (AI writer,
 * course builder), Mighty Networks (Instant Course Outline, "Make It
 * Better"), Kajabi (Cofounder AI, 500 to 1,000 AI credits on its $199 and
 * $399 plans), Teachable (Course Starter, drafts the sales page), Thinkific
 * (outline, landing page and email copy) and Beacons all write for a
 * creator. Stan's Stanley answers questions about Stan. Here it is on the
 * $29 plan, for the three things a creator most often stares at a blank box
 * over: a product's description, a course's outline, and an email.
 *
 * What it never does, because a page written for somebody else to sell with
 * has to be something they can stand behind:
 *
 *   - invent a testimonial, a review, a number of students, sales or
 *     earnings, a result, a guarantee, a bonus, a discount, a deadline or a
 *     limit on how many are left;
 *   - publish anything. It fills the boxes in the studio, the creator reads
 *     and changes them, and nothing is saved until they press Save.
