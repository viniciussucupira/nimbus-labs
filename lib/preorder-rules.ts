/**
 * Pre-orders, as rules the browser can read too (added 10 October 2026). The
 * part that keeps and hands them over is lib/preorders.ts.
 *
 * Gumroad and Payhip take pre-orders. A creator who can sell what they are
 * still making learns whether it is wanted, and is paid while they make it.
 *
 * How it works here:
 *
 *   - A paid product marked "coming soon" (lib/waitlist-rules.ts) may also
 *     take pre-orders, with the day it is expected. The creator agrees, once,
 *     to refund every pre-order in full if it does not come out.
 *   - The buyer pays the price at once, and is told the expected day and that
 *     it is handed over the day it comes out. Nothing is added at checkout
 *     and no offer follows; it cannot be a gift or bought for several people.
 *   - The checkout hands over nothing by itself (lib/bundle-rules.ts,
 *     deliveredIds). When the creator puts the product on sale, every pre-order
 *     still paid is handed over the way a gift is — written down under the
 *     buyer's address (lib/imported-purchases.ts) — and its buyer is emailed
 *     the way to open it. A product cannot be put on sale with nothing in it
 *     while pre-orders wait for it.
 *   - Pre-orders stop by themselves after the expected day. A late product is
 *     not sold to anyone else until the creator sets a new day.
