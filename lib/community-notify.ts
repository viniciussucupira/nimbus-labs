/**
 * Telling somebody something happened to them.
 *
 * Stan's own help centre says it plainly: "All Community notifications are
 * sent via email!", and the member's only choice is daily, weekly or never —
 * with the creator able to override a member's "never" on any post they tick
 * a box for. There is no in-app list to come back to. Circle, Skool, Mighty
 * Networks, Whop and Kajabi all have one.
 *
 * So there is one here, and it is the honest kind: it holds only things that
 * happened TO this person — somebody answered their post, answered their
 * comment, or named them — and never "there is new activity", which is not
 * news about anybody and is the reason people switch notifications off.
 *
 * Kept under the community's own id:
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:nt:<who>    what happened to them, newest first (sorted set)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:nt:s:<who>  when they last looked
 *
 * Nobody is ever told about their own doing: answering your own post, or
 * naming yourself, notifies nobody. A hidden post's comments notify nobody
 * either — a post the creator took down should not keep reaching into
 * somebody's day.
 *
 * A phone is told at the same moment, from here, so the two can never say
 * different things: whatever is worth a row in somebody's list is worth
 * waking their phone for, and nothing else is. What the phone is sent is
 * thinner still — who did what, and where to go, never the words.
