Products are priced in your store's currency — one of 15, US dollars unless you choose another — with one price each, up to 50 if you want the buyer to choose, or a price the buyer chooses, at or above your minimum. You can also put the file itself on each one, and open it again to check it is the right one. A long store shows 24 products a page, and your studio finds any product by name. You can cut the list into up to 20 sections with a heading over each, and put one line of your own news across the top of the page, leading to one of your products if you like.",

That page has its own title and preview card, so a link to one product shared anywhere unfolds into that product. Rename the product and its address follows; every link shared before keeps working. Share it from the studio: the link to copy, a QR code to download for print or slides, and X, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and email, each opening that site's own page to post from, with each link tagged so your numbers show which one brought visitors and sales. You can also build it as a sales page, from blocks.",

You paste an https address \u2014 a Google Drive folder, a private video page, a Notion page \u2014 and the buyer is sent there the moment they pay, with the address shown on the page and kept in their receipt.

Start from another of your products' pages (its blocks and words are copied, its pictures stay with it), from one of six templates, from a draft written with AI, or from nothing, and drag the blocks into the order you want. Translate the whole page with AI into any of the store languages in one step; names, numbers and prices stay as they are, and nothing is saved until you press Save. Add a block from a gallery grouped by what it does, at the end or right between two others, keep one to phones or to computers and tablets, or duplicate one to start the next from it. The page as it was before each of your last five saves is kept for 30 days under Earlier versions, so a save can be taken back; while you edit, Undo and Redo (Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Z) go back and forward a step at a time. On a wide screen the page is drawn beside its blocks, as visitors will see it on a phone, and redrawn as you type; press a part of it to open that block. In the reviews block you can pick up to three of your buyers' verified reviews to show first; each is marked as picked by you, and the average and the count stay those of every review. Keep it from visitors while you work on it (they see the product's plain page) and show it when it is ready, or have it show by itself at a moment you set. Choose its style: plain, in bands (every other section on a soft wash of your store's color) or in cards. It has its own title and description for search engines, and a share picture drawn from the product's picture, name, price and stars.

Up to 50 can be coming up at once, and up to 500 are kept with their replays. Members RSVP with one click, and you can cap the places at anything from 1 to 5,000.

It is a private Jitsi Meet room made for the event, which members open inside the page or in a tab of its own, your own meeting link, or a Google Meet made on your connected Google Calendar: one meeting with nobody on its guest list, so members ask to join and you let them in. Emails, calendar files and the feed point to the page, never to the room. Members who asked for the community's emails get a reminder a day and an hour before; a move or a cancellation is emailed once to everyone coming; and, if you have turned on phone notifications, you get one 15 minutes before. After it starts you can add a replay from YouTube, Vimeo or Loom.",
          "What it does not do: unlike Stan's webinars, it does not make Zoom links for you yet. On a free personal Google account, Google ends meetings of three or more people after 60 minutes. Jitsi Meet is run by a third party, and the first person to open a room may be asked to sign in to Jitsi to start it, so open it a few minutes early. Jitsi publishes no size limit for its free rooms, and big video calls there get unsteady, so for more than a few dozen people use your own meeting link.

Each affiliate is paid at the email address they joined with; the book says paid once PayPal confirms it, anyone PayPal cannot pay stays owed, and nobody is sent twice. PayPal charges you its own fee on each payment. A PayPal account in Brazil can only send these payments in reais, to Brazil, so it cannot pay through us.

For the United Kingdom and Sweden that means companies, not sole traders; and for the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Sweden, only an address that names a desk, like partnerships@ or hello@, not a person. Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy and Poland ask for the business's consent first, so nothing is written there, and for every other country we have not read the law yet, so nothing is written there either.`,

You can write at most ${PITCHES_PER_DAY} a day, and to the same business once in ${REPITCH_DAYS} days.
