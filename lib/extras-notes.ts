/**
 * What the studio says about an extra that is set up but not being shown.
 *
 * Every extra a creator adds to a product — a box at checkout, a payment plan,
 * offers after paying — depends on things that can be changed somewhere else.
 * Lower the price of the product your checkout box offers and the box stops
 * appearing. Raise a product's price and the payment plan that used to cover it
 * stops being offered. Give a product a limited number for sale and every offer
 * pointing at it goes dark.
 *
 * None of that was wrong; a box that charges more than the product costs on its
 * own should not appear. What was wrong is that the studio went on saying
 * "Offers Templates for $9 at checkout" and "Payment plan: 3 monthly payments
 * of $110" the whole time, so the only way a creator could find out was to
 * notice the money missing. An extra that is not being shown now says so, in
 * the same place it is set up, and says which product to change to get it back.
 *
 * The sentences are assembled on the server, because working out *why* needs
 * the whole store: the product a box offers may be one the studio is not
 * showing on this page, or one that no longer qualifies to be offered at all
 * and so is not in the list of choices the page was given.
