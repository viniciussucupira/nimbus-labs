/**
 * Lesson video that plays the way a video site plays it: the service.
 *
 * lib/stream-rules.ts says why a lesson's video is kept in several sizes.
 * Making and serving them is Bunny Stream's job (bunny.net). It was chosen
 * on October 6, 2026 against the two others a site like this would use,
 * from each one's own price page that day:
 *
 *   Bunny Stream       turning a file into its sizes is free; keeping them
 *                      is $0.01 a gigabyte a month in each region they are
 *                      kept in; sending them is $0.005 a gigabyte on its
 *                      volume network, $0.01 on its standard one in Europe
 *                      and North America
 *   Cloudflare Stream  $5 a month for each 1,000 minutes kept, $1 for each
 *                      1,000 minutes watched
 *   Mux                $0.0024 a minute a month kept, $0.0008 to $0.001 a
 *                      minute watched
 *
 * A course is watched by the hour. A thousand minutes of video at the
 * tallest size kept here is about forty gigabytes: forty cents sent by the
 * first, a dollar by either of the others. What decides whether a $29 store
 * pays for itself is that line, so it was the one compared; what a plan
 * covers of it, and what is charged past that, is in lib/watch-rules.ts.
 *
 * How a video gets there, and what is kept here about it:
 *
 *   1. The studio asks for a door (app/api/store/stream). A video is made
 *      at the service, empty, in the store's own collection, and the browser
 *      is handed a signature good for that one video for a day. The file
 *      goes from the browser straight to the service, in pieces, and an
 *      upload cut off halfway goes on from where it stopped
 *      (lib/tus-upload.ts). It never passes through this site.
 *   2. The lesson is told its video (app/api/store/course), by the path
 *      `stream/<folder>/<lesson>/<id>`. Nothing typed by the browser is
 *      believed: the path has to be the one this file wrote down when it
 *      opened the door, for that store and that lesson.
 *   3. The service turns the file into its sizes. It says when one is
 *      done (app/api/stream/hook), and it is asked every few minutes in any
 *      case (app/api/cron/stream), so nothing depends on an announcement
 *      arriving.
 *   4. A student's lesson page frames the service's player, with a token
 *      made here for that video, good for a few hours. Without one the
 *      player shows nothing, so the address of a lesson's video is worth
 *      nothing to somebody who did not buy the course.
 *
 * The library, as it was set up on October 6, 2026, and what this file
 * counts on it being:
 *
 *   - files kept in two regions, Frankfurt and New York ($0.02 a gigabyte a
 *     month together), sent over the volume network ($0.005 a gigabyte);
 *   - sizes from 240p to 1080p, made by the free encoder, which finishes
 *     when it finishes: until the first size is done the lesson page says
 *     the video is being prepared;
 *   - "direct play" off, and both token authentications on, the player's
 *     and the files': a video plays only in a player given a token made
 *     here. The service's own encryption of the files ("MediaCage Basic")
 *     cannot be on at the same time as token authentication, by the
 *     service's rule, and the token is the one that says who bought.
 *   - the player goes on from where a viewer stopped.
 *
 * Nothing here runs until the four settings are there:
 *
 *   BUNNY_STREAM_LIBRARY_ID  the library's number
 *   BUNNY_STREAM_API_KEY     the library's own key, which makes and deletes
 *   BUNNY_STREAM_TOKEN_KEY   the key a player's token is made with
 *   BUNNY_STREAM_READ_KEY    the library's read-only key: the service signs
 *                            its announcements with it. Optional; without it
 *                            announcements are not believed, and step 3 is
 *                            the asking alone.
 *
 * Without them a lesson's video is what it was before: the file as
 * uploaded, in the private store, played from a signed link (lib/learn.ts).
 * A video uploaded that way goes on playing that way.
 *
 *   nl:stream:v:<id>      what is known about one video
 *   nl:stream:due         which videos to ask the service about, and when
 *   nl:stream:col:<folder> the store's collection at the service
 *   nl:stream:gone        videos to delete there that could not be reached
 *   nl:stream:peek:<id>   a student's page asked about this one just now
 *   nl:stream:cap:<id>    the languages a video has captions in
 *
 * How long a store's videos have been watched is read from the service too
 * (streamWatched), and what is done with it is in lib/watch.ts.
