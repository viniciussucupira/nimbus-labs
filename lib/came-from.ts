/**
 * Which marketing channel a sale came from.
 *
 * The store already counts visitors by where they came from, and the money
 * is already read from the creator's own Stripe account. The two were never
 * joined, so a creator could see that four hundred people arrived from a
 * newsletter and that they made six hundred dollars, and never which of
 * those four hundred were the six hundred.
 *
 * Joining them needs no new record of anybody. The tags the creator puts on
 * their own links — utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign — are carried by
 * the page the buyer presses the button on, and the browser sends that page's
 * address as the Referer of the checkout. So the tags are read from there,
 * at the moment the checkout opens, and written into the Stripe session's
 * metadata. They come back attached to the money when the sale is read.
 *
 * Nothing is stored here, nothing is tracked across days, no cookie is set
 * and no visitor is identified. The record of the channel lives where the
 * record of the payment lives, which is the creator's own Stripe account.
 *
 * What this does not do, said plainly because the difference matters: it is
 * the tag on the page the buyer bought from, not a journey followed across
 * visits. Somebody who arrives from a newsletter on Monday, comes back
 * untagged on Friday and buys then is counted as direct. Tools that follow a
 * person over days do it with a cookie and a stored profile, which is the
 * thing this store has never had and is not worth having for a report.
