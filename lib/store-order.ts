/**
 * The order of the parts of a store page under the creator's name (added 9
 * October 2026).
 *
 * Every store page is one column: who the creator is at the top, then what
 * they sell, what buyers said, where else they are, a way to support them, the sign-up box, the
 * questions, the contact form and the way into the community. A creator whose
 * page is mostly links wants the links first; one whose buyers' words sell
 * best wants those above the products; one building a list wants the sign-up
 * box before anything else. So they choose the order of those parts. Not
 * where each sits beside another — the page stays one column that reads on a
 * phone — only which comes first.
 *
 * Kept as a list of the parts' names on the store's record, so drawing the
 * page reads nothing more. A part the creator has not switched on is simply
 * not drawn wherever it stands. A part added after a store chose its order
 * is put right after the part it follows in the usual order, and a name that
 * is no longer one is dropped, so a store never loses a part by having
 * arranged its page first.
