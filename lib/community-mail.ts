/**
 * A creator's announcement in their community, emailed to the members who
 * asked for it.
 *
 * Nobody is emailed who did not tick "Email me announcements" themselves,
 * and the box starts empty. Each email carries a one-click way to stop them
 * (its own link and the header a mail app reads), the creator's postal
 * address and why the reader is getting it — the same template, sender and
 * monthly allowance as the creator's emails to their list (lib/mail.ts), so
 * announcements are part of Pro's email, counted against the same number.
 * Stopping them stops only these: the member stays in the community, and
 * stays off or on the creator's list exactly as they were.
 *
 * Who it goes to is written down when it starts: the members who asked, then
 * — batch by batch, as it goes out — only those who still hold a ticket in
 * (lib/community-access.ts), so a member whose membership lapsed is not
 * emailed about a community they can no longer open. It goes out a hundred
 * at a time, each batch with its own key so a retry never sends twice, and a
 * send that outlives one run is picked up by the mail job every five minutes.
 *
 *   nl:cm:mail:<job>        the send (JSON)
 *   nl:cm:mail:<job>:to     member keys, in order (a list)
 *   nl:cm:mailq             sends waiting or under way
 *   nl:cm:unsub:<token>     community|member|handle, for the link in an email
