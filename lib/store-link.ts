/**
 * The links on a store page that are not for sale.
 *
 * This is the "in bio" half of link in bio. A creator's page is where they
 * send everyone, so it has to be able to point at the rest of their life —
 * the YouTube channel, the Instagram, the newsletter, the booking page they
 * already pay someone else for. A page that can only take money and can never
 * send anyone anywhere is a checkout, not a bio.
 *
 * A link is not a product. It has no price, it never reaches Stripe, and
 * nothing is delivered for it. That is why it lives here instead of as a
 * product with an empty price: a free thing and a thing that is not for sale
 * are different, and the page says which is which.
 *
 * The address itself is checked by readLink in lib/product-link.ts, the same
 * check a paid delivery link gets. Somebody is about to be sent wherever this
 * points and the person who typed it is not us, so it is https only, with no
 * credentials in it and no address that only resolves on the visitor's own
 * machine.
