/**
 * How long a store's lesson videos were watched this month.
 *
 * lib/watch-rules.ts says why this is the measure a plan covers and a bill
 * is made from. This file keeps it.
 *
 * The video service counts, for every video, the seconds it has been watched
 * since it was put there (lib/stream.ts, streamWatched). That is a running
 * total and not a month's, so what is kept here is the last total seen for
 * each video, and each reading adds what a video grew by since the one
 * before to the month it is read in:
 *
 *   nl:watch:last:<folder>          each video's total when last read
 *   nl:watch:sec:<folder>:<month>   seconds watched, added up, that month
 *   nl:watch:folders:<month>        the stores that had any, that month
 *   nl:watch:due                    which stores to read, and when
 *   nl:watch:opened:<folder>        when a lesson video of theirs last opened
 *
 * Read by the hour, and only where somebody is watching. A lesson page that
 * frames a video says so (opened), which puts the store in line to be read
 * ten minutes on and every hour after, until nothing of its has been opened
 * for longer than a player's token lasts. A store nobody watches is never
 * asked about.
 *
 * What this errs toward. A video that is deleted takes with it whatever was
 * watched since its last reading, at most an hour's worth: never counted,
 * never charged. A total that goes down, which the service does not do, adds
 * nothing. A reading that fails adds nothing and is made again. Every one of
 * those is in the creator's favor, which is the way round a figure that is
 * billed from has to err.
 *
 * A reading belongs to the month it is made in, so the last hour of a month
 * can land in the next. It is still counted once.
