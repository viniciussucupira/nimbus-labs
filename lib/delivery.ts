 * How much a store has sent out this month, in files.

 * itself was how many files went out. The files that are sold are now kept
 * where sending one costs nothing (lib/vault.ts), so the money has gone out
 * of this figure. What is left of it is what a storefront is for: a plan
 * covers selling one's own work, not hosting files for the internet, and a
 * store far past the published figure is told so. It is counted, published
 * and said out loud, and it is never charged for.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT do is stop a delivery. Somebody paid the
 * creator for that file. Cutting the buyer off would be taking money for a
 * sale and then not completing it, which is the thing this whole company is
 * supposed to be the opposite of. Going over is a conversation with the
 * creator, not a door slammed on their customer.
 *
 * A lesson's video is not counted here. It is the one thing that does cost
 * by use, it is measured by the time it was watched and not by the
 * gigabyte, and it has rules of its own (lib/watch-rules.ts).

 * buyer paid for that file. But the delivery that can run away without
 * anybody having paid for anything is the free one — a lead magnet that
 * finds an audience, or is posted somewhere it was not meant to go, and is
 * pulled fifty thousand times.
 *
 * So free copies pause at fifty gigabytes a month, by themselves, and start
 * again when the month turns. Nobody is cut off from something they bought,
 * because nobody bought it, and the creator is told the same day.
 *
 * Fifty was set against money: at the eleven cents a gigabyte the host's own
 * file store charges for a file too large to cache, it is $5.50 against the
 * $27.86 a $29 subscription leaves after the card fee, and the figure it
 * replaced, 400 GB, could cost $44 a month on its own. A brake set above the
 * revenue it protects is not a brake. A file that is sold is now kept where
 * sending it costs nothing (lib/vault.ts), and the host's store is shut to
 * new ones (app/api/store/file), so the brake no longer guards a bill. It
 * stays where it was, because what it stops was never only a bill: a plan
 * is for a storefront, not for handing a file to the whole internet.
 *
 * And it is not tight for giving things away. Fifty gigabytes is a ten
 * megabyte lead magnet downloaded five thousand times in a month. A store
 * past it is not running a storefront any more.
