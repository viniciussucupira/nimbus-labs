/**
 * A cart (added 10 October 2026): several of a store's products in one
 * payment, as rules the browser can read too. The checkout is built in
 * lib/cart-checkout.ts.
 *
 * Gumroad and Payhip have one. Here a cart is the store's own: a visitor adds
 * products from their cards and pages, sees them with their prices as they
 * are now, and pays for all of them at once on the creator's own Stripe
 * account. Each is handed over exactly as if bought on its own, because the
 * order names them the way a checkout's added products are always named
 * (lib/bundle-rules.ts, BUMP_KEYS), and every page and email that hands
 * things over already reads that.
 *
 * What can go in one is what one plain payment can sell: a paid product at
 * one price, sold once, that nobody has to choose, book, hold or answer
 * questions for first. Up to MAX_CART at a time, which is how many products
 * one order can name.
