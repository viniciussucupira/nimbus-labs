 * Video watched past what a plan covers, put on the creator's next invoice.

 * lib/watch-rules.ts says what is covered and what an hour past it costs;
 * lib/watch.ts keeps how long each store's video was watched. How a month
 * is settled, and why never twice, is in lib/usage-billing.ts, which this
 * shares with the other thing charged by use (lib/traffic-billing.ts). What
 * is here is video's own part: what it is measured in, what it comes to,
 * and what its line on the invoice says.
 *
 * Until this existed the Terms said a charge would be made that nothing
 * made, and the one cost here with no ceiling had nothing set against it.
