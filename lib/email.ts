/**
 * The one place that sends email.
 *
 * Everything that needs to reach an inbox goes through here, so there is a
 * single answer to "is sending switched on?" and a single place that knows
 * who sends.
 *
 * There are two senders. Amazon SES is the cheaper by nine times (lib/ses.ts
 * has the prices and the date they were read), and is used whenever Amazon
 * says the account may write to the public. Resend is the one this site
 * started on, and stays underneath as the floor: every email Amazon does not
 * take — the account is still being looked at, is paused, has used its day,
 * is not answering — goes through Resend in the same breath, so no email
 * waits on Amazon and none is lost to it. With Amazon's settings absent,
 * everything goes through Resend exactly as before.
 *
 * Nobody chooses between them by hand. Which one sends is decided here, for
 * each email, from what Amazon last said.
