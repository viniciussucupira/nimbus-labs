 * is not built, and is not sold. Several stores per account are built, and are not a Pro feature: an

 * plan of its own, Creator or Pro. Funnels and affiliates are built and are

 * $35M of yearly revenue in 2025, growing 24% after 93% the year before, and
 * named the cause as a flat price with nothing to move up to. A store whose
 * list has outgrown Pro had the same wall here: the month's emails ran out
 * and the only answer was to wait for the first of the next one.
 *
 * So this is Pro with three times the email, at the price Kajabi charges for
 * the plan a business of that size is on. It is the same product with a
 * larger number, said as that: nothing is held back from Pro to make it look
 * better.
 *
 * Seventy-five thousand, set against the price like Pro's own number. At
 * $0.0009 an email that is $67.50 at the top. With every other brake at its
 * limit too the plan costs about $102 against the $241 a monthly charge
 * leaves, and against $193 a month on the yearly price: 58% kept in the
 * worst month on the one and 47% on the other, more than Pro keeps on
 * either (tests/plan-margin.test.ts adds it up). A hundred thousand was the
