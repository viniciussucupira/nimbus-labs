/**
 * Keeping a creator's secrets unreadable at rest, without a new secret to set.
 *
 * Some things a creator gives us are keys to their other accounts: the API
 * key of their Mailchimp, Kit, beehiiv or MailerLite (lib/email-sync.ts).
 * Those are kept in Redis, like everything else, and Redis is reached with a
 * token that sits in more places than we would like — the hosting dashboard,
 * the database provider's console, a developer's shell. So a key like that is
 * sealed before it is written: AES-256-GCM, a fresh random nonce for every
 * seal, and the name of what it belongs to (the store and the purpose) bound
 * in as associated data, so a sealed value copied into another store's record
 * does not open there. Somebody holding a copy of the database, and nothing
 * else, reads noise.
 *
 * The key that seals is not stored anywhere. It is derived, with HKDF-SHA256
 * and a fixed label per purpose, from one root secret the deployment keeps
 * apart from the database:
 *
 *   - NIMBUS_DATA_KEY, when it is set (32 characters or more; `openssl rand
 *     -base64 32` makes one). A secret with no other job, so it never has to
 *     change because something else did.
 *   - Otherwise STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, which every deployment that sells already
 *     has, so the owner creates nothing on deploy.
 *
 * Consequences, each handled rather than hidden:
 *
 *   - The derived keys are one-way: nothing sealed here, and nothing derived
 *     here (the web push key pair in lib/web-push.ts is derived the same way,
 *     with its own label), says anything about the root secret itself, and a
 *     derived key that leaked says nothing about the other derived keys.
 *   - Rolling the root secret changes every derived key. Each sealed value
 *     carries a short fingerprint of the key that sealed it, so a value
 *     sealed under an old one is recognised as such and the studio says so
 *     plainly ("paste your API key again"), and phones are asked to turn
 *     notifications on again, instead of anything failing in silence. With
 *     the Stripe key as the root, a Stripe key rolled after a leak does this
 *     too — the reason NIMBUS_DATA_KEY exists.
 *   - Setting NIMBUS_DATA_KEY on a deployment that has been sealing under
 *     the Stripe key breaks nothing: from then on everything is sealed under
 *     the new key, and what was sealed before still opens with the key
 *     derived from STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (it is only ever used to open, never to
 *     seal) for as long as that key is unchanged. A value opened that way is
 *     sealed again under the new key the next time its settings are saved;
 *     phones subscribed under the old push key keep being sent to with it,
 *     and move to the new one by themselves the next time the studio is
 *     opened on them (components/phone-alerts-panel.tsx).
 *
 * Sealed text looks like "s1.<fingerprint>.<nonce>.<ciphertext and tag>", all
 * base64url, and is only ever handled on the server.
