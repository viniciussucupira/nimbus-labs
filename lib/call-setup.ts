/**
 * A paid call: what the creator offers, when, and the arithmetic of time.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network, so the studio can use the same rules in
 * the browser that the server enforces, and the booking page can show exactly
 * the times the server will accept.
 *
 * A call is sold in one of two ways, and both are the same product underneath:
 *
 *   - weekly hours ("weekly"): the creator says when they are free each week
 *     and buyers pick a time inside it. Each time has a number of seats — one
 *     for a one-to-one call, up to MAX_SEATS for a group call — and stays open
 *     until every seat is taken;
 *   - dated live sessions ("live"): a webinar or workshop the creator puts on
 *     particular days. Each session has its own date, time, length, seats (up
 *     to MAX_SESSION_SEATS) and meeting link, and buyers pick one.
 *
 * Either way one payment buys one seat at one start time, so the rest of the
 * booking machinery — holds, the lock, Stripe as the ledger, the emails — has
 * only one thing to count: seats taken at a start time, per product.
 *
 * Time is the hard part, and it is done without a library. The creator's
 * week is written in their own time zone — "Mondays from 9 to 12" — and every
 * slot is turned into one exact instant, in UTC, using the time zone database
 * the platform already carries (Intl). Daylight saving is handled by asking
 * that database, twice, what the offset is at the instant being built, which
 * is the standard way to do it and the only one that survives the two days a
 * year the clocks move.
