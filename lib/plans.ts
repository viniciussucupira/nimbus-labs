/**
 * Payment plans: ending them after the last payment.
 *
 * A plan is a subscription on the creator's own account that must stop by
 * itself after a fixed number of payments. Stripe cannot be told that when
 * the checkout is opened, so once the first payment is through the
 * subscription is given the exact moment it ends — the end of the period the
 * last payment covers — and Stripe then never charges again.
 *
 * That is done as soon as the buyer is back from paying, and a scheduled job
 * goes over every plan opened since, so a buyer who paid and closed the tab is
 * never charged one payment too many. Long before the second payment is due,
 * the plan knows when to stop.
