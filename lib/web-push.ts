/**
 * Web Push, by hand: the key pair that identifies us to the push services,
 * the encrypted message, and the one request that hands it over.
 *
 * A phone that turned notifications on for the studio (lib/phone-alerts.ts)
 * gave us a subscription: an https address at its browser's push service
 * (Apple's for Safari on iPhone and Mac, Google's for Chrome and Android,
 * Mozilla's for Firefox, Microsoft's for Edge on Windows) and two keys of the
 * browser's own. A notification is a POST to that address, and two standards
 * say what goes in it:
 *
 *   - RFC 8292 (VAPID): the request carries a short token signed with our
 *     P-256 key, and the public half of that key, so the push service knows
 *     the message comes from whoever the browser subscribed with. The browser
 *     was given that public key when it subscribed, and the service refuses a
 *     message signed with any other.
 *   - RFC 8291 with RFC 8188 (aes128gcm): the message is encrypted for the
 *     browser alone, with a fresh key pair for every message, so the push
 *     service carries it without being able to read it.
 *
 * Why not the `web-push` npm package: its last release was in January 2024,
 * and what it does fits in this file with nothing but node:crypto, which
 * also lets every request go through lib/safe-fetch.ts.
 *
 * The VAPID key pair is not a new environment variable. It is derived, with
 * HKDF-SHA256 and the fixed label VAPID_LABEL, from the deployment's
 * existing server secret (lib/secret-box.ts explains which one, and why): the
 * 32 bytes are the private scalar, used only if 1 <= d < n, the order of the
 * P-256 group — otherwise the next counter value is tried, which for
 * HKDF output happens about once in four billion — and the public key is
 * computed from it. So the key is the same on every deploy and every
 * instance, nobody has to create or copy it, and it changes only if that
 * server secret is rolled; a subscription made under the old key is then
 * recognised by its fingerprint and the phone is asked to turn notifications
 * on again (the studio does it by itself when it is next opened there). When
 * the root moves from the Stripe key to NIMBUS_DATA_KEY, the pair derived
 * from the Stripe key is kept for the phones that subscribed with it
 * (vapidKeysFor), so none of them goes quiet in between.
 *
 * The addresses messages may go to are a fixed list of push services
 * (PUSH_HOST), checked before anything is sent, and the request itself goes
 * through lib/safe-fetch.ts, which refuses private networks and follows no
 * redirect: a subscription is written by a browser, and a browser is written
 * to by whoever holds it.
