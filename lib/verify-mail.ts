/**
 * The whole way a bounce travels, run against the real senders, every day,
 * by a scheduled job (app/api/cron/mail-check).
 *
 * The protection in lib/mail-health.ts depends on a chain no test in this
 * repository can hold together, because half of it is somebody else's: the
 * sender takes a list email with its tags, a mailbox refuses it, the sender
 * announces that to our address with the tags still on it, the announcement
 * is believed, and the address comes off the list. If any link is changed on
 * the sender's side — a tag dropped, an event renamed — nothing here fails
 * and nothing says so; the protection is simply no longer there.
 *
 * So once a day a list that is nobody's is made, with two addresses on it
 * that each sender keeps for exactly this:
 *
 *   Resend      bounced@resend.dev, complained@resend.dev
 *               (resend.com/docs/dashboard/emails/send-test-emails)
 *   Amazon SES  bounce@simulator.amazonses.com,
 *               complaint@simulator.amazonses.com
 *               (docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/send-an-email-from-console.html)
 *
 * Both say these do not count against a sender's reputation (read October 6,
 * 2026). One email goes to each, tagged as a list email is, through the
 * sender being checked and no other. The check passes when each address has
 * come off the list and been counted, which only happens if every link held.
 * Then the list and everything counted for it are taken away again.
 *
 * Two more things are looked at while here, because the day they go wrong is
 * otherwise found out by an email not arriving:
 *
 *   - the token the host gives each request is the one Amazon is told to
 *     trust (lib/ses.ts, TRUSTED_TOKEN);
 *   - Amazon lends a key for it and says what the account may do.
 *
 * A sender that is not set up is not checked, and is said so, not failed.
