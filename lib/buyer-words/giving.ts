/**
 * The words of what a store gives, hands out and asks after the sale, in the
 * store's language (lib/store-language.ts): a free copy and its email, a
 * waitlist and its emails, the places of a purchase for several people, a
 * gift's emails, leaving a review and the email asking for one, the reminder
 * to a buyer who left the payment page, a license key, and the email after a
 * PayPal purchase.
 *
 * Every language says everything English says, and nothing more. Prices,
 * dates and counts arrive already written (lib/buyer-words/index.ts, speech);
 * a sentence here only places them.
 *
 * Browser-safe: no server code, so lib/waitlist-rules.ts and lib/group-rules.ts
 * can read it too. Client components are handed the strings already said
 * (licenceKeyBoxWords, groupLinkBoxWords), never this file.
