 * Every word an affiliate, a partner or a list subscriber meets that the

 * words a store adds around a creator's own email to their list
 * (lib/mail.ts, lib/winback-send.ts) and the page a reader stops those emails

 *
 * Amounts, dates and counts arrive already written in the store's language

 * Emails to the creator themselves stay in English, like their studio.
