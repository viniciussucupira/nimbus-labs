 * Two different lists, on purpose:
 *
 *   - What a bundle offers a buyer who has not paid yet is its list as the
 *     creator saved it, each product as it is now, leaving out anything that
 *     can no longer be handed over whole (deliverableItems).
 *   - What a buyer who paid gets is the list written on their order when
 *     they paid (lib/bundle-rules.ts, bundleFromMeta), each product as it is
 *     now — its current file, link or lessons, exactly as a buyer of that
 *     product on its own gets them. A product the creator has since removed
 *     from the store is gone for them too, as it is for its own buyers, and
 *     the pages say so rather than hiding it.
