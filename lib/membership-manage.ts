/**
 * A member cancelling on their own.
 *
 * A membership is charged on the creator's own Stripe account, so the member
 * is the creator's customer, and until now the only way out was to write to
 * the creator and wait. That is the kind of cancellation people remember, and
 * not kindly. Here the member types the address they pay with, we email a
 * link to it, and the link opens Stripe's own page for their membership on
 * the creator's account: cancel, change the card, see the receipts.
 *
 * Three things are deliberate:
 *
 *   - It works whatever state the creator's own Marktmorgen subscription is in. A
 *     store that stops paying us stops selling; it never traps anybody in a
 *     charge they want to stop.
 *   - The page answers the same whether or not the address has a membership,
 *     so it cannot be used to find out who is a member of what.
 *   - Opening the email link never does anything. Mail scanners open links;
 *     only the button on the page it leads to asks Stripe for the portal.
 *
 * Cancelling ends the membership at the end of the period already paid for,
 * which is what the member has bought and is the fair default.
