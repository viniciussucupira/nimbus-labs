/**
 * Notifications on the creator's phone: a sale, a booking, a report in the
 * community, an application from an affiliate.
 *
 * The studio installs as an app on a phone's home screen (app/studio/layout
 * .tsx, public/studio.webmanifest), and from there, or from any browser that
 * has Web Push, the creator turns notifications on for that device. The
 * browser hands us a subscription (lib/web-push.ts); it is kept here with the
 * events that device wants, up to MAX_DEVICES per person per store — a phone,
 * a tablet, a laptop or two — each with its own choices, and each can be
 * sent a test or removed from the studio.
 *
 * Devices are each person's own. A store can have a team (lib/team.ts), and
 * everyone on it turns notifications on for their own devices and sees,
 * changes and removes only those; nobody sees anybody else's. What a device
 * may hear is what its person's role may see (EVENT_NEEDS below, read from
 * lib/team-roles.ts), checked when it is chosen and again, against the role
 * the person has at that moment, every time something is sent — so a person
 * taken off the team, or moved to a role that does not see sales, stops
 * being told at once. A device kept before there were teams is the owner's.
 *
 * A notification is sent where the thing is written down, after the answer
 * has gone (after()), so no buyer, member or applicant ever waits on a push
 * service:
 *
 *   sale       every paid order, noticed by the thanks page or by the
 *              five-minute job for a buyer who never came back, and every
 *              one-click offer paid after it (lib/sale-events.ts): the amount
 *              and the product. A booked call is told as a booking instead.
 *   booking    every booked call or seat, when it is confirmed
 *              (lib/calls.ts): the product, the time and what was paid.
 *   report     a member reported a post or a comment (told once for each
 *              post or comment, however many members report it).
 *   affiliate  somebody confirmed an application to the affiliate programme.
 *   live       a live event in the community starts in fifteen minutes
 *              (lib/community-event-mail.ts): its title, its time, how many
 *              said they are coming. A device kept before this event existed
 *              that hears of bookings hears of these too, until its person
 *              switches them off.
 *
 * What a notification says is written for a lock screen: amounts, product
 * titles and times, never a buyer's name or email address. Each is sent
 * once: a sale or a booking by its checkout, a report by what was reported,
 * an application by the affiliate. Reports and applications are at most
 * QUIET_PER_HOUR an hour per store, so a flood of either cannot bury the
 * phone; sales and bookings are never held back. A device that turned
 * notifications off (the push service says the subscription is gone) is
 * forgotten on the spot. A device subscribed under a key we no longer have
 * is marked, and the studio subscribes it again the next time it is opened
 * on that device.
 *
 *   nl:phone:cfg:<statsId>          { handle, devices }
 *   nl:phone:st:<statsId>           device -> how the last send went
 *   nl:phone:seen:<hash>            an event already sent, forty days
