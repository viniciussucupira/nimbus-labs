/**
 * A come-back offer to somebody whose membership ended: one email, some days
 * later, with a discount to return.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Patreon's Autopilot sends
 * win-back and cancellation offers; Mighty Networks has cancellation
 * follow-up automations; Circle sends reactivation emails from payment
 * activity; Whop messages a member when they leave. Stan, Skool, Kajabi and
 * Gumroad document none. The cancel page here already makes one offer to a
 * member on their way out (lib/save-offer.ts); this is the second chance,
 * after they have gone.
 *
 * What it is, precisely:
 *
 *   - One email per ended membership, the number of days after it ended that
 *     the creator chose, and at most one per person and product in half a
 *     year, however many times they come and go.
 *   - Only to somebody who agreed to hear from the creator and has not left
 *     the creator's list, with the list's own one-click unsubscribe, and the
 *     creator's postal address, which US law asks of every commercial email.
 *   - Never to somebody who has already come back.
 *   - A discount the creator chooses, a percentage off one to three payments,
 *     made as a coupon on the creator's own Stripe account and applied by
 *     Stripe's own checkout. A multi-payment offer is made only on monthly
 *     memberships, where months and payments are the same thing.
 *   - The link works for OFFER_DAYS days, only for the address it was sent to,
 *     and the checkout it opens takes no free trial a second time.
 *
 * Pure, so the studio's form can read the choices without anything that
 * talks to Stripe. The sending is in lib/winback-send.ts.
