/**
 * A creator's store: the handle, and the few facts the public page shows.
 *
 * Two records in Redis, both plain and both small:
 *
 *   nl:store:handle:<handle>  -> the store's key (below), written with NX so a
 *                                handle can never be taken twice
 *   nl:store:owner:<hash>     -> the store itself, as JSON
 *
 * The handle record is the lock. It is written first and only if free, so two
 * people asking for the same name at the same moment cannot both win.
 *
 * One account may run up to five stores. Every store is found by its key:
 *
 *   - an account's first store by its owner's sign-in email, exactly as every
 *     store was before there could be more than one, so a store made then
 *     is read, written and moved the way it always was;
 *   - every other store by "#" and an id of its own, which no email can be,
 *     so the two kinds of key never meet. It does not change when the owner
 *     moves to another address, because nothing in it is the address.
 *
 * Three small records tie them together:
 *
 *   nl:account:stores:<hash>  -> the ids of an account's other stores (a set)
 *   nl:store:id:<id>          -> the key of the store with that id, so a store
 *                                can be named in a cookie or a link by an id
 *                                that says nothing about who owns it
 *
 * Each store keeps its own handle, its own Stripe account, its own plan and
 * its own folders of files; nothing is shared between two stores but the
 * person who owns them. Every function below that takes a store's key calls
 * it `email` for the first kind and works the same for the second.
