/**
 * Who may come into a store's community, asked again on every request.
 *
 * The creator chooses which of their products open it. Buying any one of
 * them is the ticket, read from the creator's own Stripe account — the
 * record of who paid for what — and never from anything a visitor says:
 *
 *   - a one-off product, a call or a course: a settled payment that was not
 *     refunded in full (a payment plan counts from its first payment, as it
 *     does for a course);
 *   - a membership: only while its subscription is live — active, in its
 *     trial, or with a payment being retried. A membership that is cancelled
 *     or stops being paid closes the door on the next check;
 *   - something free, when the creator includes it: the address confirmed it
 *     reads its own inbox by using the link we emailed (lib/free.ts), and the
 *     creator's list says so;
 *   - a purchase the creator brought over from another platform
 *     (lib/imported-purchases.ts) of a product that opens the community, or
 *     of a bundle that held one. Only the store's owner and Admins can bring
 *     buyers over, a membership never can be, and the creator's "remove"
 *     closes the door on one of them as on anybody.
 *
 * A product added in the box at checkout, or in one click after it, counts
 * the same as one bought on its own.
 *
 * Nobody makes an account. A member is somebody whose address is proved the
 * way a course student's is (lib/learn.ts): a link emailed to the address,
 * after which the browser holds the store's pass for 90 days, or a Nimbus
 * sign-in with that address. A pass made in the browser that paid for one
 * course opens that course only, and is not enough here: the community is
 * where a member is seen by others, so the address has to be shown to be
 * theirs, not only to have been typed at a checkout.
 *
 * Stripe's answer is kept for five minutes when it lets somebody in and for
 * one minute when it does not, so a page does not wait on Stripe every time
 * and somebody who just bought is not kept out for long. A membership that
 * lapses therefore loses the door within five minutes; the creator taking a
 * member out (lib/community.ts, `removed`) is read on every request and is
 * immediate.
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:ok:<address key>   Stripe's latest answer, with the settings' version
 *   nl:cm:link:<hash>             an emailed link: who, which store (1 hour)
