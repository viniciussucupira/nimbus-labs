/**
 * Comments under a course's lessons, as rules the browser can read too. The
 * part that keeps them is lib/lesson-comments.ts.
 *
 * Who may write: a student of the course, on a lesson that is open to them,
 * and the creator. A visitor looking at a free preview reads nothing and
 * writes nothing: what students say to each other stays among the people who
 * paid for the course.
 *
 * What others see: the name the student chose the first time they wrote,
 * never their email address. The creator's words are shown under the store's
 * name, marked as the creator's.
 *
 * What the creator can do: answer from the lesson itself or from the studio,
 * hide a comment (the student who wrote it still sees it, marked hidden, and
 * nobody else does), delete one, and switch comments off for a course, which
 * hides them all and closes the box without deleting anything.
