/**
 * Sends a sold file from the creator's browser straight to the file store,
 * in pieces, and goes on when a piece fails.
 *
 * The other half of the door in app/api/store/vault. The browser asks for
 * the upload to be opened, then, a few pieces at a time, for an address for
 * each piece; it sends each piece to its address and keeps what the store
 * answers for it (the piece's `ETag`), and at the end hands those back so
 * the pieces can be joined. A file of one piece goes up whole, the same way.
 *
 * A piece that fails is sent again after a pause that grows. Its address is
 * asked for afresh each time, because an address is good for an hour and a
 * long upload outlives several. The upload gives up only when one piece has
 * failed through every pause, and then says so and lets the store throw away
 * what did arrive.
 *
 * Runs in the browser. It asks for nothing but a way to post to our door and
 * a way to put a piece, so the tests stand in for both
 * (tests/vault-upload.test.ts).
