/**
 * The one store here that is ours: the demo store.
 *
 * "Live demo store" used to be a page written by hand. It looked like a
 * store and its checkout was real, but none of it was the code a creator's
 * store runs on — so what a visitor tried was not what a creator's buyers
 * get, and the speed published for it was not the speed of a store.
 *
 * Now it is a store: a record like any creator's, made through the same
 * functions the studio calls (lib/demo-seed.ts), drawn by the same pages,
 * sold through the same checkout and handed over by the same download. This
 * file is the short list of ways it is, on purpose, not like the others —
 * every one of them because it is the only store whose buyers pay nothing:
 *
 *   - It sells in Stripe's test mode whatever the site's own key is
 *     (lib/demo-account.ts), and its pages say so before anybody reaches a
 *     card form.
 *   - Nobody can sign in as its owner. It is changed by changing the code
 *     that makes it, and in no other way.
 *   - It takes no reviews. A review here would be words from anybody at all
 *     under "verified purchase", on a page of ours, with no creator to answer
 *     for them — and a purchase costs nothing.
 *   - It writes to no buyer (lib/purchase-email.ts): a checkout that takes
 *     any address for free must never be a way to send somebody an email.
 *
 * Everything else about it is whatever a store on the $29 plan is.
 *
 * Nothing is imported here, so a page drawn in the browser can read the
 * store's address without carrying anything else along.
