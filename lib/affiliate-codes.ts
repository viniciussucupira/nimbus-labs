/**
 * Crediting a sale to the affiliate whose discount code the buyer typed.
 *
 * Why this exists. Every affiliate programme in this business — Hotmart's,
 * Stan's, Kajabi's, and ours until now — credits a sale from a cookie dropped
 * when somebody clicks a link. That works for a link in a bio and nowhere
 * else. An affiliate who reads a code out on a podcast, says it from a stage,
 * prints it in a PDF, or puts it in the caption of a video that does not take
 * links, produces no click at all, so there is no cookie and no commission —
 * and the sale they made is credited to nobody. Safari takes the rest: it
 * holds a first-party cookie written by a script for seven days, and caps the
 * life of cookies generally, so even a real click can be gone before a buyer
 * who thinks about it for a fortnight comes back.
 *
 * A code has none of those problems. It is said out loud, it is remembered, it
 * survives any browser, and it is typed by the buyer themselves at the moment
 * they pay. So a creator may hand one of their own discount codes to one
 * affiliate, and any sale that used it earns that affiliate their share, cookie
 * or no cookie.
 *
 * What this does not do, on purpose:
 *
 *   - it does not make the code. The codes are the creator's own, already on
 *     their own Stripe account (lib/discount.ts): a Coupon and a Promotion
 *     Code that belong to them, that they can see in their own dashboard, and
 *     that they take with them if they leave. All that is kept here is which
 *     affiliate a code was given to;
 *   - it does not price anything. Stripe decides what the code takes off, at
 *     the moment the buyer types it. The commission is then worked out on
 *     what was actually paid, like every other commission here;
 *   - it never overrides a click. A sale that already carries an affiliate
 *     from the cookie keeps that affiliate. The code is read only when the
 *     cookie had nothing to say, which is the whole case it is here for.
 *
 * One record, under the store's own stats id so it moves with the store:
 *
 *   nl:aff:<id>:promo   hash  Stripe promotion code id -> affiliate id
