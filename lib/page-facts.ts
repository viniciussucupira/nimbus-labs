 * Each is there only when it is true and worth saying: a course with no lesson
 * yet has no lessons fact, a product bought fewer than ten times — or on a
 * store whose look hides how many times things were bought — has no buyers
 * fact, a product with no visible review has no rating. The page and the
 * studio's preview ask this same function, so the preview never promises a
 * number the page would not show.
