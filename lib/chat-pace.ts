/**
 * How often an open room asks whether anything is new: the rules.
 *
 * The room has no socket held open (lib/community-chat.ts): the page asks.
 * Until October 7, 2026 it asked every four seconds for as long as its tab
 * was in front, of a route that read the store, the member and the room
 * each time: a function call and about ten commands to the database for
 * every look. One member with the room open for a working day cost about
 * seventeen cents, a hundred of them more than five hundred dollars a
 * month, on any plan, and nothing was set against it.
 *
 * Three things replace that:
 *
 *   - The look is small and shared. What is asked every few seconds is
 *     "what came after message N", at an address that knows nobody and
 *     that the CDN may answer for everybody in the room at once
 *     (app/api/store/community/chat/new). It is opened by a pass the room's
 *     page is handed (lib/chat-pass.ts), and costs one read of the database
 *     when the CDN has no answer and none when it has.
 *   - The asking follows the room. Every LIVE_MS while people are talking
 *     and the reader is there; every IDLE_MS while the room is quiet; not at
 *     all while the tab is in the background or the page has not been
 *     touched for AWAY_AFTER_MS. Somebody who comes back is asked for at
 *     once.
 *   - It is counted. A member's page is given leave to ask for ten minutes
 *     at a time (lib/chat-grant.ts), at one pace or the other, and each
 *     leave is counted toward the store's visits as what it can cost at the
 *     most (lib/traffic-rules.ts). So the room is covered by the plan like
 *     a page is, charged past it like a page is, and rests with the store's
 *     pages where there is no plan to charge.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network or reads another file: the page, the
 * routes and the tests read the same figures.
