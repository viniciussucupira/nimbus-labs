/**
 * What the public API hands out, and in what shape.
 *
 * Every object here is built field by field from a list written out below —
 * never by spreading a stored record. Stored records carry things that must
 * never leave: a contact's unsubscribe token, a member's internal flags, an
 * affiliate's private note. A field added to a record later stays inside
 * until somebody decides, here, in writing, that it goes out.
 *
 * Each reader is the one the studio already uses for the same list, so the
 * API can never show a creator something different from what their own
 * dashboard shows them.
 *
 * Every time goes out as an ISO 8601 string in UTC, whatever it was kept as —
 * seconds for members and students, milliseconds for bookings and
 * affiliates, text already for contacts — so no tool has to guess the unit.
