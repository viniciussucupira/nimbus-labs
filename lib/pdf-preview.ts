/**
 * The first pages of a product's PDF, readable by anyone before buying.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (7 October 2026): Gumroad lets a creator show
 * a preview of a file, Amazon's "Look inside" made it the expected way to buy
 * a book, and Payhip and Etsy sellers attach sample pages by hand. Stan has
 * nothing of the kind. Someone deciding whether forty recipes are worth $27
 * decides faster with three of them in front of them.
 *
 * What it is:
 *
 *   - A separate file, cut from the original with pdf-lib: its first N pages
 *     (1 to 10, the creator's choice), and nothing else of it. The original
 *     never leaves the private store this way, and no page past N is in the
 *     copy to be found.
 *   - Made once per original and number of pages, kept beside the stamped
 *     copies (lib/pdf-stamp.ts, copyFolder), so it is deleted with the
 *     original, and its record kept in Redis.
 *   - Counted as a free download (lib/serve-file.ts, paid: false), so it
 *     pauses with the store's other free downloads if a link to it runs away;
 *     nothing anybody bought is ever affected.
 *   - Only for a PDF up to MAX_STAMP_BYTES that pdf-lib can read. Anything
 *     else simply has no preview, and the studio says why.
 *
 *   nl:preview:<sha(pathname|addedAt|pages)>   the preview's ProductFile, JSON
