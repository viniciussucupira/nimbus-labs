/**
 * Points, levels and the leaderboard of a community — and what a level opens.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Skool gives 1 point per
 * like, 9 levels, a leaderboard, and courses that unlock at a level, on every
 * plan. Circle gives 1 point per like, levels, leaderboards and content
 * unlocked for engaged members. Mighty Networks has points, streaks, badges
 * and leaderboards. Stan has none of it. So a community here has the same
 * rule people already understand — a like is a point — and three things the
 * others do not do together:
 *
 *   - a level can open a space for posting, and can hand over one of the
 *     creator's own paid courses, free, as a reward;
 *   - every member sees exactly how the points are made and what each level
 *     opens, on the leaderboard page, with nothing hidden in an algorithm;
 *   - a point cannot be given to yourself, and the creator's own likes count
 *     the same as anybody's — no weighting that members cannot see.
 *
 * How a point is made: every like a member's post or comment receives from
 * somebody else is one point to its author, and taking the like back takes
 * the point back. The creator collects no points: the board is for members.
 *
 * Kept, under the community's own id (no import of lib/community.ts, so the
 * course reader in lib/learn.ts can ask about rewards without a cycle):
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:pts            all-time points, by member key (sorted set)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:pts:d:<day>    points made on one UTC day (kept 32 days)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:rw             what each level opens: { level, product }[]
 *   nl:cm:<id>:unl:<member>   when each reward reached this member (hash)
