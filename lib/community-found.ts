/**
 * Turning what the index found into what one person may actually be shown.
 *
 * The search index knows nothing about who is asking, and that is deliberate:
 * one index serves the creator and every member, and the door is asked about
 * afterward. This is that afterward, and it is the part where getting it
 * wrong would matter most — a lesson title is content. "Week 4: the $40k month
 * spreadsheet" tells somebody who never bought the course something they did
 * not pay for, and a search that leaked it would be worse than no search.
 *
 * So every kind goes through the very same gate its own page goes through, and
 * not a looser one written for here:
 *
 *   post    the feed's space gate, and the creator's hidden posts
 *   lesson  holdsAnyOf on the product the course is sold with — the same
 *           question the course page asks, cached under the same key
 *   event   mayAttend, the same call the event's own page makes
 *   member  the directory's own switch: listed, named, not removed
 *
 * The count of matches the tabs show comes from the index and so counts things
 * this reader may not see. That is on purpose and it is said plainly on the
 * page: the alternative is running the gate over every match of every kind to
 * draw four numbers, which for a member of a large community would mean asking
 * Stripe about products they have nothing to do with.
