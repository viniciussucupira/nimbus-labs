/**
 * A fair price for each buyer's country: the same product, cheaper where
 * money buys less, so a buyer in India or Brazil pays what a buyer in the
 * United States pays in effort rather than in dollars.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (8 October 2026). Gumroad has it, as
 * "purchasing power parity", and this site's comparison page said so as one
 * of the things Gumroad is ahead on. Kajabi has it only through an outside
 * app (ParityDeals sells one), and neither Stan's nor Hotmart's help pages
 * mention it. Gumroad's code is public (github.com/antiwork/gumroad), and the
 * rules here follow the same sense:
 *
 *   - the price level is the World Bank's (lib/fair-price-data.ts);
 *   - a country whose prices are above 80% of the US level gets nothing off,
 *     and nor does any high-income country on the list below, whatever its
 *     prices: the point is buyers who earn less, not cheap shopping;
 *   - nothing goes below the creator's own floor: they pick the deepest
 *     discount they accept, at most 60% off, as Gumroad's floor of 0.4 is.
 *
 * The creator decides all of it, for their own store only: whether it is on
 * at all (off on every store until they switch it on), whether the World
 * Bank's numbers suggest the discount for every country or only the
 * countries they list get one, and, country by country, how much — a level
 * of their own, from 5% to 90% off, or none at all, which takes a country
 * the numbers would lower off the list. And which products: every one it
 * can cover, or only those they pick, as a sale does — a $9 file can stay at
 * its price while a $199 course is lowered, as Gumroad lets a seller switch
 * it off product by product.
 *
 * Percentages are whole multiples of five, rounded down, so a buyer is never
 * given more off than the numbers say and the creator's Stripe account holds
 * at most eighteen coupons for it, one per level.
 *
 * What it covers is what a sale across the store covers (lib/store-sale.ts,
 * `saleable`): a product bought once at one price the store sets. When both
 * apply, the larger of the two is taken, never both.
 *
 * Said plainly to the creator, because it is true: the country is read from
 * the buyer's internet connection. Somebody using a VPN can be shown another
 * country's price, and the card's country is not checked before paying,
 * because Stripe's own payment page does not let a platform look at the card
 * first. The floor is how the creator limits what that can cost.
 *
 * Browser-safe: the studio shows the same numbers the store charges.
