/**
 * A partner's standing share of a product.
 *
 * What Hotmart calls Coprodução and files under its own "sales management and
 * strategy" section: somebody who helped make the product, or who lent their
 * audience to its launch, takes a percentage of every sale of it — not only
 * the sales they personally referred. It is the difference between an
 * affiliate and a partner, and it is the reason a creator with no audience can
 * borrow one: an affiliate earns on the buyers they bring, a partner earns on
 * the product, so they have a reason to keep selling it after the launch week.
 *
 * Why ours is not a split at the moment of payment, which is how Hotmart does
 * it. Hotmart can divide a charge because Hotmart holds it. Here the money goes
 * from the buyer straight into the creator's own Stripe account and never
 * touches us — dividing it in flight would make us the intermediary this whole
 * product exists to not be. So a partner's share is recorded against each sale
 * and paid by the creator, automatically, out of their own PayPal, on the day
 * they already promised their affiliates (lib/paypal-payouts.ts). The partner
 * needs no account anywhere: an email address that can receive PayPal is all.
 *
 * Two guards that Hotmart does not appear to have, and that matter because the
 * creator is the one left holding the product:
 *
 *   - the shares committed on one product are capped, so a creator cannot
 *     accidentally promise away more of a sale than it contains. An affiliate
 *     commission rides on the same sale, so the cap has to count both;
 *   - a partner never earns on their own purchase, for the same reason an
 *     affiliate does not: a 50% partner buying their own product at 50% off
 *     is not a sale, it is a discount with extra steps.
