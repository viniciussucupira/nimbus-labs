/**
 * A store's community: the place where the people who bought from a creator
 * talk to the creator and to each other.
 *
 * Who may come in is decided in lib/community-access.ts, on every request.
 * This file only keeps what they write, and keeps it small and bounded, with
 * every key under the community's own id so nothing here can be reached from
 * another store:
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:cfg            the settings: name, spaces, who gets in, pins (JSON)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:seq            a counter; every post takes the next number
 *   nl:cm:<id>:p:<post>       one post (JSON)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:feed           every post, by number (sorted set)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:sp:<space>     the posts of one space, by number (sorted set)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:c:<post>       the comments under one post (hash)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:l:<post>       who liked one post (set of member keys)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:lc:<post>:<c>  who liked one comment (set of member keys)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:m              everyone who has come in: key -> Member (hash)
 *   nl:cm:<id>:dir            those who chose to be listed, by joining time
 *   nl:cm:<id>:rep            reported posts and comments, newest first
 *   nl:cm:<id>:rep:<target>   who reported one of them, so a report counts once
 *   nl:cm:rl:<id>:<who>:<k>   how much one member did lately, for the limits
 *
 * A member is known by a key made from their address (lib/learn.ts emailKey),
 * and the address itself is kept only in their own record, for the creator's
 * moderation list and for the announcement emails they asked for. No other
 * member ever sees it: the directory shows the name a member chose, and only
 * when they chose to be listed.
 *
 * Feeds are read a page at a time by post number, which is unique and only
 * grows, so a page never repeats or skips a post however many are written
 * while somebody reads.
 *
 * Every limit is in lib/community-text.ts, where the studio reads it too.
