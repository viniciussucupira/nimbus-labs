/**
 * Leave for one member's page to ask a room what is new, ten minutes at a
 * time, and the count of it.
 *
 * lib/chat-pace.ts says why the room asks the way it does. This is where
 * each ten minutes of asking is handed out and counted toward the store's
 * visits (lib/traffic-rules.ts): ROOM_LIVE_PARTS hundredths of a visit for
 * ten minutes at the pace of a room that is talking, ROOM_IDLE_PARTS at the
 * pace of a quiet one. A page asks for the pace it needs, is told what it
 * got, and keeps to it.
 *
 *   - Counted once for a member's ten minutes, whatever they do in them: a
 *     page drawn again, a second tab, a phone and a laptop. A quiet leave
 *     that turns into a talking one is counted for the difference.
 *   - The pace of a talking room is given only while the room is talking.
 *     A page cannot ask its way into the dearer count.
 *   - The creator is never counted, as on every other page of their store.
 *   - A store with no plan to charge, past the visits it has, is given no
 *     leave: its room is read by asking for it (a button), like a page that
 *     rests, and nothing is counted. A store that pays is never refused.
 *
 *   nl:cm:<id>:rg:<member>   the leave a member holds: until when, and what it was counted as
