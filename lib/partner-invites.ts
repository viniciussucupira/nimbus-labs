/**
 * A partnership offered to somebody who already has a store here.
 *
 * Inviting a partner normally goes by email: the terms are in the message,
 * and opening the link is how the person agrees to them (lib/affiliates.ts
 * invitePartner). That is right for somebody from outside, who has no other
 * place to be asked.
 *
 * It is the wrong shape when the invited partner is already a creator here,
 * because then there is a better place to ask them: their own studio. An
 * email is found or lost; a studio is opened on purpose. So the offer waits
 * there, with the share and the products written out, to be accepted or
 * declined.
 *
 * What this is NOT is a shortcut past the agreement. A share of every sale of
 * a product is a commercial arrangement, and the person taking it has to say
 * yes to the number. Recognising somebody as a customer of ours is a reason to
 * ask them somewhere better, never a reason to stop asking. Nothing is written
 * into the inviting store's programme until they accept.
 *
 * And this is the quiet part worth naming: every partnership between two
 * creators here ties both of them to the same place, through a relationship
 * neither of them wants to break. A hundred of those is a denser thing than a
 * hundred separate stores, and it is the one network effect that does not
 * require operating a public marketplace to get.
