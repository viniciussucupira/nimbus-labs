/**
 * Reading the spreadsheets creators bring from other platforms, and writing
 * the ones we hand back.
 *
 * A file exported by Stan, Gumroad, Kajabi, Mailchimp, Excel or Google Sheets
 * can arrive in any of a handful of shapes, and every one of them has to read
 * the same:
 *
 *   - a byte-order mark at the start (Excel's "CSV UTF-8" writes one), which
 *     is dropped rather than read as part of the first column's name;
 *   - commas, semicolons (Excel in much of Europe) or tabs between cells —
 *     whichever the first line uses outside quotes;
 *   - cells in double quotes, holding the separator, line breaks, or a quote
 *     written twice ("") for one;
 *   - lines ending in \r\n, \n or \r, and blank lines, which are skipped.
 *
 * It reads text, not bytes: the browser decodes the file as UTF-8 before this
 * sees it, so accented names and every alphabet come through as typed.
 *
 * A cell we write back into a spreadsheet — an error report, an export — is
 * always quoted, and one that begins with =, +, -, @ or a tab (after any
 * spaces) gets a ' in front, so a spreadsheet shows it as text instead of
 * running it as a formula. A name like "=HYPERLINK(...)" in a creator's own
 * file never becomes a link in the report we give them.
 *
 * Pure, so the studio's own screen and the server read a file the same way.
