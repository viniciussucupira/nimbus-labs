/**
 * A waitlist on a product that is not on sale yet, as rules the browser can
 * read too. The part that keeps it is lib/waitlist.ts.
 *
 * Measured before it was built (30 September 2026): Stan has no waitlist —
 * its "Product coming soon!" notice only means the store has no way to pay
 * connected (help.stan.store, article 367). Whop's waitlist takes addresses
 * and answers to questions and admits people one by one, and says nothing of
 * an email when the product comes out (docs.whop.com, "Create a waitlist").
 *
 * How it works here:
 *
 *   - The creator marks a paid product "coming soon". Its card and its page
 *     show a waitlist form instead of a buy button, and no checkout opens.
 *   - A visitor types their address. It counts only once they press the
 *     button in the email it gets, so nobody is put on a waitlist by someone
 *     else, and the box to hear from the creator beyond it starts empty.
 *   - The creator presses "Put it on sale and tell the waitlist". The product
 *     goes on sale that moment, and everyone who confirmed gets one email
 *     with its link, its price and, if the creator wrote one, a short note.
 *     That email is the only one the waitlist sends; afterward the addresses
 *     are deleted, except where their owner also asked to hear from the
 *     creator, in which case they are on the creator's list.
