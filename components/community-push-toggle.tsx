/**
 * Turning notifications on for this device.
 *
 * Three things this does that most of these do not, all for the same reason —
 * a notification somebody believes in and does not get is worse than one they
 * never expected:
 *
 *   - It says what it will and will not tell them, before they decide.
 *   - On iPhone and iPad it explains that the page has to be on the home
 *     screen first, with the steps, instead of offering a switch that cannot
 *     work. Apple requires that, not us.
 *   - When the browser has already been told no, it says so plainly, because
 *     no amount of pressing the button here can undo that: only the site's own
 *     settings in the browser can.
