 * The pieces every community page is made of: the bar across the top, a
 * member's badge, a post's text with its links, a post in the feed, and the
 * small forms behind every button.
 *
 * Everything a member wrote reaches the page as text through React, which
 * escapes it; the only thing turned into markup is a web address that
 * lib/community-text.ts has already checked is an ordinary http or https one.
 * Every button is a plain form, so the community works before, and without,
