/**
 * The price and one button, held at the bottom of a phone's screen while a
 * product's page is read (app/[handle]/p/[product]/page.tsx).
 *
 * Measured before it was built (7 October 2026): Shopify's own themes,
 * Gumroad's product page and most course platforms keep a buy bar in view on
 * a phone; a Stan product page does not. On a long sales page the buy box is
 * a dozen screens down, and a reader who has decided should not have to go
 * and find it.
 *
 * It does nothing a page's own buttons do not: it is a link to the page's
 * own buy box (#buy, or #get for something free), where the buyer still
 * picks an option, a plan or a box at checkout. It steps out of the way while
 * that box is on screen, so the two are never shown at once, and it is not
 * drawn on a wide screen at all (app/globals.css, .st-sticky-buy). Without
 * JavaScript it simply stays, which is still a link to the right place.
