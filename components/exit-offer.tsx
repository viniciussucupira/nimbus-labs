/**
 * The creator's free product, offered once to a visitor who is about to
 * leave (lib/exit-offer.ts, chosen in the studio).
 *
 * Measured before it was built (7 October 2026): Hotmart's checkout and
 * Whop's store pages both offer a popup as a visitor leaves; Stan has none.
 * What keeps this one fair:
 *
 *   - Only on a computer, when the pointer leaves through the top of the
 *     window — the move toward the tabs or the address bar — and only after
 *     the visitor has been on the page a few seconds. Never on a phone, where
 *     "about to leave" cannot be told from scrolling, and never on load.
 *   - Once per visitor per store in a month, remembered in this browser only.
 *     Closed with the button, Escape, or a click outside; nothing comes back.
 *   - It offers something free, says so, and asks for nothing but an address,
 *     with the same unticked box for more email the page itself has. No
 *     countdown, no "wait!", no discount that was not on offer to everyone.
