        The photographs come from one other host, and a browser cannot start
        fetching from it until it has looked the name up, opened a connection
        and agreed a certificate — three round trips that only begin when the
        first <img> is read, deep into the page. Saying the name here starts
        that handshake while the HTML is still arriving, so the first picture
        lands sooner on the connection where it matters, which is a phone on
        mobile data. React lifts this into the head itself.

          The switch that lets sections start hidden and rise into view.

          Everything with `.reveal` on it is at full opacity in the stylesheet
          until this line runs, and it only runs where the thing that brings
          those sections back exists: a browser with JavaScript and an
          IntersectionObserver, and a reader who has not asked for less
          motion. If the script never runs — JavaScript off, a crawler, a
          proxy that drops it, a bundle that fails — the page is simply all
          there. An animation is worth having; a page whose middle is blank
          because an animation did not start is not.

          It is a plain synchronous script as the first thing in the body, so
          it sets the attribute before the first paint and nothing flashes.

          dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{

        {/*
          And the thing that brings them back, at the end of the body.

          This used to be a React effect, which meant the sections were
          hidden at first paint and uncovered only once the bundle had
          downloaded, parsed and hydrated. On a good connection that gap is
          invisible. On a phone on mobile data it is seconds of a page with
          a header and nothing under it — the visitor is looking at the
          blank middle the comment above says must never happen, and the
          cause is the animation itself.

          So the observer starts here instead, as plain script at the end of
          the body: it runs the moment the HTML is parsed, before any bundle
          is asked for, and it is not waiting on React to be alive. Anything
          already on screen is shown at once — a visitor who has not scrolled
          has not scrolled to it — and only what is still below the fold is
          left for the observer. If any of it throws, the attribute comes
          off and the whole page is simply there.

          The React component on each page does the same work again on a
          client-side navigation, where no script in this file runs a second
          time. Adding the class twice costs nothing.
