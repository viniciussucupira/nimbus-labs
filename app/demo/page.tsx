 * The address everybody has for the demo, and has had from the first day:
 * marktmorgen.com/demo. It is not a page of its own any more.
 *
 * The demo is a store like any creator's (lib/house-store.ts) and lives where
 * stores live, at /@harborkitchen. This makes sure it is there and is what
 * the code says it should be (lib/demo-seed.ts) — one read on any ordinary
 * visit — and sends the visitor to it. Every link that says /demo keeps
 * working, and none of them leads to anything but the real thing.
 *
 * The few sentences below are only ever read if the store could not be made:
 * a visitor is told so, instead of being sent to an address with nothing on it.
