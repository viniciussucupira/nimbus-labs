      <LegalSection title="1. Information we collect">
        <p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Account information.</strong> When you
          create an account or subscribe, we collect your email address and any
          other information you choose to provide (such as your name, if
          requested at checkout).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Payment information.</strong> Payments
          are processed by Stripe, our payment processor. We do not store your
          full credit or debit card number, CVC, or equivalent payment
          credentials. Stripe may collect billing name, address, and
          payment method details as needed to complete the transaction. We may
          receive limited payment metadata, such as the last four digits of a
          card, payment status, and subscription period.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">What a creator puts in a store.</strong>{" "}
          If you run a Marktmorgen store, we host what you put in it: your store
          name and description, your photo if you add one, the theme and color
          you choose, your product titles, prices and descriptions, the links
          you put on the page, and the files you upload for delivery to your
          buyers. Your photo is shrunk on your own device before it is sent, is
          shown publicly on your store page and in previews of links to it, and
          is deleted from our storage when you remove or replace it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Buyer information.</strong> When
          someone buys from a creator&apos;s store, we handle the buyer&apos;s
          email address and the details of that order — what was bought, when,
          for how much, and whether the file was delivered — so the sale can be
          completed and the creator can see it. The card details are handled by
          Stripe and never reach us. That buyer information belongs to the
          creator, not to us, and section 4 explains what that means.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">A confirmation of each purchase.</strong>{" "}
          After a buyer pays, we email them one confirmation on the
          creator&apos;s behalf, under the store&apos;s name, with what they
          bought and how to get back to it; replies go to the creator. What it
          says is read from the payment on the creator&apos;s Stripe account.
          We keep only a mark that it was sent, tied to that checkout, for 40
          days, so it is never sent twice. If a creator asks buyers questions
          at checkout, the answers are kept with the payment on the
          creator&apos;s own Stripe account, shown to the creator, and for a
          booked call included in the creator&apos;s booking email.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">A reminder after an unpaid checkout.</strong>{" "}
          Only on stores whose creator switched it on, and only for a buyer who
          agreed on Stripe&apos;s own checkout page to hear from that creator:
          if they leave without paying, we email them once, on the
          creator&apos;s behalf, with a link back to the product. Stripe keeps
          the address and the answer on the creator&apos;s account. We keep a
          mark that the reminder for that checkout was handled, for two weeks;
          a one-way hash of the address and the product for a week, so nobody
          gets two reminders about the same thing; and the link in the reminder
          that stops them, tied to the address and the store, for 400 days.
          Pressing it keeps a one-way hash of the address for that store for
          good, so that store never sends them a reminder again.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">A come-back offer.</strong> Only on
          stores whose creator switched it on, and only to somebody who agreed
          to hear from that creator and has not left their list: some days
          after a membership ends, we read from the creator&apos;s Stripe
          account when it ended, which product it was and the address it was
          paid from, and email that address once, on the creator&apos;s behalf,
          with a discount to come back. We keep a mark that the email for that
          membership was handled, for 90 days; a one-way hash of the address
          and the product for 180 days, so nobody gets two such emails about
          the same thing; and the link in the email, tied to the address, the
          product and the offer, for 14 days. It carries the creator&apos;s
          list&apos;s own one-click unsubscribe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Managing a membership.</strong> When
          a member asks for a link to manage or cancel their membership, we use
          the email address they type to look for their membership on the
          creator&apos;s own Stripe account and, if there is one, to email them
          the link. We keep a record that ties that link to their Stripe
          customer for one hour and, to limit abuse, one-way hashes of the
          address and of the network address that asked, also for one hour,
          and nothing else; the page says the same thing whether or not a
          membership was found. When a member switches their membership to
          another of the store&apos;s plans, the change is made on the
          creator&apos;s Stripe account, which keeps the record of it, and we
          email the member a receipt and the creator a note with the
          member&apos;s email address and the two plans. We keep nothing more
          about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Getting a purchase again.</strong>{" "}
          When a buyer asks a store for what they bought, we use the email
          address they type to look for their paid purchases on the
          creator&apos;s own Stripe account and, if there are any, to email them
          a link to a page that lists them. We keep a record that ties that link
          to the address for 24 hours and, to limit abuse, one-way hashes of
          the address and of the network address that asked, for one hour, and
          nothing else; the list itself is read
          from Stripe each time the page opens, and the page says the same thing
          whether or not a purchase was found.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Counting visits to a store.</strong>{" "}
          When a creator&apos;s store page is opened, the page tells us so,
          with the site that sent the visitor or the campaign word in the link.
          To count people rather than page loads we make a one-way fingerprint
          of the day, the store, the visitor&apos;s network address and browser,
          and add it to a counter that keeps only an estimate of how many
          different fingerprints it has seen. The fingerprint and the address
          are not stored, no cookie is set, and the daily counts are kept for
          about thirteen months, with a running all-time total of the same
          counts for as long as the store exists. The creator sees totals,
          never a person.
        </p>
        <p id="ads">
          <strong className="text-black">
            Ad measurement a creator switches on.
          </strong>{" "}
          A creator can add their own Meta, Google, TikTok or Pinterest pixel to
          their store. When they do, and only once it is allowed, that
          store&apos;s pages load that platform&apos;s script, which sets its own cookies and tells
          the platform about page views, checkouts started, requests for free
          products and purchases with their amount, on the creator&apos;s behalf
          and under that platform&apos;s own privacy policy. Visitors in the
          European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or Brazil,
          or whose country we cannot tell, are asked first and nothing loads
          unless they agree; everywhere else the
          pixels load unless the browser sends Global Privacy Control. The
          choice is kept on the visitor&apos;s device for that store, and a link
          at the foot of its pages changes it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Booking a call.</strong> When someone
          books a paid call, we use the time they picked, their time zone and
          the email address on their Stripe receipt to hold that time while they
          pay, to write the booking down, and to send one confirmation to them
          and one to the creator. So that each can answer the other, the
          buyer&apos;s confirmation has the creator&apos;s email address as the
          address replies go to, and the creator&apos;s has the buyer&apos;s.
          While they pay, a cookie in the buyer&apos;s browser names the
          checkout they opened, for 32 minutes, so that going back to pick
          another time releases the first one. The buyer and the creator are
          each reminded of the booking a day and an hour before, from a queue
          that names the booking and its time, and we keep a mark that each
          reminder was sent for 14 days. If the buyer moves the booking
          to another time from the link in their email, we keep the new time
          and how many times it was moved, tied to that checkout, for 200
          days. The same kind of cookie, for
          the same 32 minutes, is set when someone starts to buy a product sold
          in a limited number, so that pressing buy again hands back the one
          they were holding.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Payment plans and sales tax.</strong>{" "}
          When a buyer chooses a payment plan, Stripe keeps their card on the
          creator&apos;s account for the remaining payments, and we keep the
          checkout on a list until the plan has been given its end date, so it
          stops after the last payment. When a creator switches on sales tax,
          Stripe asks the buyer for the address it needs to work the tax out,
          under Stripe&apos;s own privacy policy; we do not keep it.
        </p>
        <p id="podcasts">
          <strong className="text-black">Private podcasts.</strong>{" "}
          When you get the feed of a private podcast you bought, we keep your
          email address with a private feed address made for you, so your
          podcast app can read it. Each time the app reads the feed or fetches
          an episode, we check that your address still holds the podcast, and
          we count those reads to stop a feed from being shared; we do not
          keep which episodes you play. The creator sees neither your feed nor
          what you listen to.
        </p>
        <p id="packages">
          <strong className="text-black">Packages of sessions.</strong>{" "}
          When you buy a package of calls, we keep your email address, which
          payment it was, how many sessions it holds, its last day to book,
          and which bookings were made from it, so you can book the rest from
          the link we email you and see how many are left. A package with a
          last day to book is kept until a year after that day; one with no
          time limit is kept for as long as it can be used. Each session is a
          booking like any other and is kept the same way.
        </p>
        <p id="gifts">
          <strong className="text-black">Gifts.</strong>{" "}
          When you buy something as a gift, we keep the recipient&apos;s email
          address, the name and the message you typed, and which payment it
          was, for about 13 months, so the gift can be handed over, shown on
          their list of purchases and taken back if the payment is refunded.
          We email the recipient once, with your name, your message and a link
          to open it; they are not added to the creator&apos;s list and receive
          nothing else from it unless they ask. You get the receipt. What was
          given is kept under the recipient&apos;s address, like a purchase of
          their own.
        </p>
        <p id="waitlists">
          <strong className="text-black">Waitlists.</strong>{" "}
          When you join the waitlist for something a creator has not put on
          sale yet, we keep your email address, when you joined and whether you
          checked the box to hear from the creator otherwise, and we email you a
          button to confirm it. Once it is confirmed, you get one email when the
          product goes on sale; then the waitlist&apos;s addresses are deleted.
          Only if you checked the box is your address added to the
          creator&apos;s list, once confirmed. The creator sees how many people
          are waiting, not who. Unconfirmed sign-ups are kept until the product
          goes on sale, and a link in every waitlist email removes your address
          at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Courses.</strong>{" "}
          When someone buys a course, we note the email address they paid with
          and when, so the course opens for them and modules that open over
          time open on the right day. The browser that paid keeps a cookie for
          a day so the course can open right away, and any browser let into
          a course keeps a cookie for 90 days so the student does not have to
          ask again. For each student we keep when they joined, when they last
          opened the course and which lessons they marked done; the creator
          sees this in their studio, and we email the student when a module
          opens for them. A student taken off a course by its creator is kept
          on a list so the course stays closed to them. To check who bought a
          course, we ask the creator&apos;s own Stripe account by email address.
        </p>
        <p id="lesson-comments">
          <strong className="text-black">Comments under lessons.</strong>{" "}
          A student who comments under a lesson chooses a name, and we keep that
          name, what they wrote and when, until they or the creator delete it or
          the course is deleted. The creator and the other students of that
          course see the name and the words; nobody sees the student&apos;s email
          address. When the creator answers a comment, we email the student who
          wrote it, at most once an hour for each lesson. A creator who asked
          for it gets a notification on their phone with the lesson and the
          start of the comment, without the name.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">A one-click offer after paying.</strong>{" "}
          When a product is followed by a one-click offer, Stripe keeps the
          buyer&apos;s card on the creator&apos;s account for payments the buyer
          makes while present, and a cookie in the buyer&apos;s browser, for two
          hours, lets only that browser take the offer. We keep a record of
          whether the offer was taken, tied to that order, for eight days.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">
            Free copies, and a creator&apos;s list.
          </strong>{" "}
          When you ask a creator&apos;s store for something they give away for
          free, we collect your email address, what you asked for, when, and
          whether you checked the box saying you want to hear from that creator.
          The box starts empty. We send you one email, with the link to what
          you asked for, and nothing else. When you use that link, your address
          is added to that creator&apos;s list, marked with your choice, and
          the creator can download the list. If you never use the link, the
          request is deleted after 7 days and your address is not added to
          anything. To limit abuse, we also keep a one-way hash of your email
          address, and of your IP address, for one hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Emails from a creator.</strong> A
          creator on the Pro plan can email the people on their list who agreed
          to hear from them: those who checked the box when they got something
          free or bought, and those the creator imports after confirming that
          each of them agreed. We send those emails on the creator&apos;s
          behalf, under the creator&apos;s name, through our email provider.
          For each one we use your address, the email the creator wrote and a
          random code for your unsubscribe link. We do not put tracking pixels
          or tracked links in them. When you unsubscribe — one press, from the
          link or your mail app&apos;s own button — we record it and when, and
          you are not written to by that creator again unless you check their
          box again yourself.
        </p>
        <p id="community">
          <strong className="text-black">A creator&apos;s community.</strong>{" "}
          When a creator opens a community on their store, we decide who may
          come in by looking up the email address a person types on the
          creator&apos;s own Stripe account, on that creator&apos;s list for
          something free, or among the buyers the creator brought over from
          another platform, and we email that address a link that works for one
          hour. Using it sets a cookie for that store in their browser for 90
          days, the same one a course uses. For each member we keep their email
          address, the name they choose to be seen by, whether they chose to be
          listed in the member directory and to be emailed announcements, when
          they joined and were last there, and whether the creator muted or
          removed them. We keep what members write: posts, comments, the
          pictures they add, likes, and reports of a post or comment. Posts,
          comments, pictures and likes are seen by the other members and by the
          creator. The directory shows only the chosen name, and only of those
          who asked to be listed. A member&apos;s email address is seen by the
          creator and never by other members. What is written is kept while
          the community exists, until its author or the creator deletes it;
          deleting a post deletes its comments, likes, reports and picture.
          Who reported something is kept for 90 days, so each member&apos;s
          report counts once. The answer about whether someone may come in is
          kept for up to five minutes, a record of each announcement emailed
          and who it went to for up to 60 days, the code in a member&apos;s
          unsubscribe link with their member record, and, to limit abuse, one-way hashes
          of the address and network address that asked for a link for one
          hour.
        </p>
        <p id="live-events">
          <strong className="text-black">Live events in a community.</strong>{" "}
          When a member says they are coming to a creator&apos;s live event
          (an RSVP), we keep that they are coming and when they said so,
          under a one-way key made from their email address, with the event;
          giving the place back removes it. The creator and the people on
          their team see who is coming, with the name and email address the
          community keeps for each member. Reminders a day and an hour before
          go only to members who asked for the community&apos;s emails; a
          move or a cancellation is emailed once to everyone coming. For each
          of those emails we keep a record of it and of who it went to for 30
          days, so it is never sent twice. For an event kept for the buyers
          of some products, the answer to whether a member holds one is
          looked up on the creator&apos;s Stripe account and kept for up to
          five minutes. An event, with the list of who is coming, is kept
          until the creator deletes it once it is over or canceled, or until
          it makes room for a newer one after 500 are kept. When a member
          presses Join here, the event&apos;s video room loads from Jitsi Meet
          inside the page, with the name they chose in the community filled
          in as their name in the room, where the others in it see it. A
          replay is a YouTube, Vimeo or Loom video that loads from that
          service only when a member presses play, and so does a video on a
          creator&apos;s sales page, when a visitor presses play.

          A creator can bring spreadsheets from another platform. The file is

          match: for a list, email address, name, labels and consent; for
          products, title, price, description and link; for past buyers,
          email address and product. We keep the rows as they came, which
          rows were already seen, the report of rows not brought in (each
          with its row number, column, reason and value), the buyers still to
          be emailed, and the import&apos;s own record (the file&apos;s name,
          who started it and its counts) for 14 days after the import began,
          and then delete them. Contacts are added to the creator&apos;s list
          only when the creator confirms that the people in the file agreed
          to hear from them; each is marked as imported, with when, and keeps
          the name and labels from the file. An address that unsubscribed from
          that creator is never added back. For each past buyer we keep which
          products they were given, when and by which import, stored against
          a one-way hash of their email address, for as long as the store
          exists; nothing is charged, no receipt is made, and these are never
          counted as sales. When that person opens the store&apos;s list of
          purchases or its community with that address, we use it to look up
          what they were given. If the creator checks it, each past buyer gets
          one email from the store&apos;s name, through our email provider,
          saying what moved and how to open it. We send it on the
          creator&apos;s instruction and on their word that these people
          bought from them and may be told so, which we cannot check against
          the other platform. A store may send up to 20,000 of these in 30
          days, and for that we keep only a count.

          When someone follows an affiliate&apos;s link to a store, a cookie
          named <code>nl_via_</code> followed by the store&apos;s address holds
          the affiliate&apos;s code and the time of the click, for up to 90
          days; a purchase counts for the affiliate only within the window the
          creator set. Visitors in the European Economic Area, the United
          Kingdom, Switzerland or Brazil, or whose country we cannot tell, are
          asked first, because the rules there require consent: the cookie is
          set only if they allow it, and their answer is kept in their browser
          for that store. To count a click once per visitor per day we keep a
          one-way hash of the visitor&apos;s network address and browser for
          two days. When a purchase counts, we note which product, when, what
          was paid before tax and in all, and the share it earns, and never
          the buyer&apos;s name or email address. Where a creator lets buyers
          join without applying, a buyer who presses &ldquo;Get my link&rdquo;
          joins with the email address their order was paid with, which we read
          from the creator&apos;s Stripe account for that order. When someone applies to be an
          affiliate, we keep their email address, the note they wrote, their
          code, when they applied and what the creator decided, the PayPal
          address they choose to be paid at, if they give one (we email the
          address they joined with whenever it changes), their clicks
          and sales, and the payments the creator records to them with the
          date and reference the creator types. An affiliate who signs in to
          their page keeps a cookie named <code>nl_aff_</code> followed by the
          store&apos;s address, for 30 days. The creator sees all of this; an
          affiliate sees only their own figures. It is kept with the
          store&apos;s records. We never hold or pay out an affiliate&apos;s
          money: the creator pays them. A creator who pays from their own
          PayPal through us gives us the Client ID and Secret of an app in
          their PayPal Business account; we keep the Secret encrypted, never
          show it again and delete both when they disconnect. Each time they
          pay, we send PayPal each affiliate&apos;s email address, the amount
          and a note, and PayPal sends the money from the creator&apos;s PayPal
          to the affiliate&apos;s, under PayPal&apos;s own privacy policy; we
          keep which PayPal batch and payment paid which affiliate.

          invite&apos;s code, for 60 days, and it is removed when a store is
          made. When the first store of a new account is made with it, we keep
          which store invited which, and when. To add the credit the invite
          earns, we read from our own Stripe account the payments the invited
          account made to us, and keep, for each, the amount credited, its
          date and whether it is on the plan yet. The inviting creator sees the
          invited store&apos;s public name and address, when it was made,
          whether it is in its trial, paying or not, and the credit it earned
          them, and never its email address or what it sells or earns. Kept

          A creator can give us the private iCal address of up to three of

          busy times, never a title, guest or place, and each reading for up to
          six hours. The calendar&apos;s provider sees our request for it. A
          creator also gets a private address of their own that lists their
          upcoming calls and sessions with the name and email address of each
          buyer, for the calendar app they subscribe with; replacing that

          refund happens in their store, we send that address a message with
          its details, which can include the buyer&apos;s name and email
          address, the product and the amount. What happens to it there is the
          creator&apos;s choice and responsibility. We keep each address and its
          signing secret until the creator removes it, a mark of each event

          see it again and the creator can see who has it, and whether the
          creator revoked it. Anyone can ask whether a key is valid; the answer

          course progress. A certificate keeps the name exactly as the student
          typed it, the course title, the creator&apos;s name, the
          student&apos;s email address and when it was issued or withdrawn.
          Its page shows the name, the course, the creator and the date to
          anyone who has its address, is kept out of search engines, and never
          shows the email address. Certificates are kept for good, so the page

          For each member we keep their sign-in address, their role and when
          they joined, and, for each person, which stores they are on, so
          their studio can find them. A store keeps an activity log of its last
          500 lines: when, who (their sign-in address), their role and what
          they did, such as a change they made in the studio, a file they
          downloaded or a change to the team. The owner sees the team and the
          log, and is emailed when someone joins or changes role. The team,
          its invitations and its log are deleted with the store, and a member
          taken off the team or who leaves is removed from it at once.

          the kinds of connection the device reported, whether it is kept in a
          synced keychain, and when it was added and last used; the private
          half never leaves their device. Each is kept until they remove it.
          Signing in with a passkey sets a cookie named <code>nl_pk</code> for

          it has not used, we email its owner when it happened, how, and the

          A creator can connect their own Mailchimp, Kit, beehiiv or MailerLite
          account with an API key. We encrypt the key before it is stored, keep
          its last four characters to show them, and delete it when they
          disconnect. When someone who agreed to hear from that creator asks
          for something free and confirms it, or buys and agreed, we send that
          platform their email address, their first name when the payment
          carries a name, and the tags the creator chose, to add them to the
          audience, form, publication or group the creator picked. Nobody who
          did not agree is sent, and we then keep no address for them. For
          each person sent we keep a record of how it went, with their address
          and first name, for up to a week, the last 50 of them in the
          creator&apos;s studio, and a one-way hash of each person and event
          for 30 days so nobody is sent twice. What happens on the platform is

          device and passes through the push service of that browser&apos;s

          chose to show (or &ldquo;Verified buyer&rdquo;), the order reference
          and the payment it came from, when it was written and changed,
          whether the creator hid it or answered it, and whether the payment
          was later refunded. The buyer&apos;s email address is not kept with
          the review and is never shown; the review&apos;s code is a one-way
          hash that includes it, so one buyer has one review per product. The
          review, with the chosen name, is public on the store; its buyer can
          change or delete it, and the creator can hide it but not change it.
          Deleting the product deletes its reviews.
          If the creator switches on the email that asks for a review, we put
          each paid order on a list with when it was paid, send its buyer one
          email on the creator&apos;s behalf, and keep a mark that its buyer
          was asked, for 120 days. The link in that email, tied to the order and
          the address it went to, works for 60 days; its link to stop being
          asked works for 400 days, and pressing it keeps a

          stay on the creator&apos;s calendar or Zoom account. If the creator
          removes our app from their Zoom account, Zoom tells us and we delete
          every connection that user made, with its tokens, at once. If the
          creator withdraws our access in their Google account, we stop using
          the connection and tell them, and disconnecting deletes it.

      <LegalSection title="4. If you buy from a creator’s store">
        <p>
          The store belongs to the creator, not to us. For the personal data of
          that store&apos;s buyers, and of the people who ask it for something
          free, the creator is the controller and Marktmorgen
          is their processor: we handle that data to run the store on
          their behalf and on their instructions, and we do not use it for our
          own purposes, do not sell it, and do not email a creator&apos;s
          buyers or list to market anything of ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same is true for the members of a creator&apos;s community, the
          people who apply to their affiliate program, their students&apos;
          quiz answers and certificates, and their buyers&apos; reviews: the
          creator is the controller, and we handle that data on their behalf.
          When a creator connects an email platform, Google Calendar or Zoom,
          or chooses Jitsi Meet for their calls and events, that is the
          creator&apos;s choice, and the data sent or
          used there is governed by the creator&apos;s account and that
          service&apos;s own terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice this means a request about your data as a buyer — a copy
          of it, a correction, a deletion — is answered by the creator you
          bought from. Write to them first. If you write to us instead, we will
          pass it on and tell you we did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two things stay ours in that situation: the security of the systems
          the data sits in, and the legal obligations we have to keep records
          of our own, such as fraud prevention and anything the law requires us
          to retain.

          short-lived cookies described in section 1, a
          creator&apos;s store may set these, each for that store alone: a pass
          that lets a
          browser into a course or a community, named <code>nl_learn_</code>{" "}
          followed by a code for the store, for 90 days; the code and time of
          an affiliate link a visitor followed, named <code>nl_via_</code>{" "}
          followed by the store&apos;s address, for up to 90 days; and an
          affiliate&apos;s own sign-in, named <code>nl_aff_</code> followed by
          the store&apos;s address, for 30 days. The ad pixels a creator may
          add are described in section 1 and are asked for first where the law
          says so. A creator&apos;s own browser keeps <code>nl_device</code>{" "}
          for 400 days and <code>nl_store</code> for a year, and{" "}
          <code>nl_pk</code> for five minutes while signing in with a

          active and as needed for tax, accounting, and legal purposes. Support
          emails are retained as long as
          needed to resolve your request and maintain a reasonable business
          record.
        </p>
        <p>
          A creator&apos;s list is kept for as long as their store exists, or
          until the creator, or the person on it, asks us to remove an address.
          A request for a free copy whose link is never used is deleted after
          7 days. An address that unsubscribed from a creator stays on that
          list, marked as unsubscribed, so it is never written to again; if you
          ask for it to be deleted entirely instead, it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          A community&apos;s posts, comments, pictures and member records are
          kept while the community exists, until the author or the creator
          deletes them. An affiliate program&apos;s records, license keys and
          the list of who holds them are kept with the store&apos;s records.
          Certificates are kept for good, so their pages keep proving what
          they say. Webhook deliveries are kept for up to seven days, and the
          mark that an event was sent for 30 days. A calendar reading is kept
          for up to six hours, and the calendar address until the creator
          removes it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A store&apos;s team, invitations and activity log are kept until the
          store is deleted, and invitations run out after seven days. Passkeys
          are kept until removed, and the record of the browsers an account
          signed in from until 400 days after its last sign-in. Email drafts are kept until
          sent or deleted. An email platform&apos;s key is kept until the
          creator disconnects it, each record of a person sent there for up to
          a week, and the mark that they were sent for 30 days. A device&apos;s
          notification address is kept until it is removed or turned off.
          Reviews are kept until their buyer deletes them or the creator
          deletes the product. A video room&apos;s address is kept for 60 days after
          its call.
        </p>
        <p>
          A live event and its list of who is coming are kept until the
          creator deletes the event once it is over or canceled, or until it
          makes room after 500 are kept; the record of each event email, for
          30 days. What an import from another platform sends us is deleted 14
          days after it began, except the contacts it added to a list, kept as
          the list is, and what past buyers were given, kept for as long as the
          store exists. A Google Calendar or Zoom connection is kept until the
          creator disconnects it or removes our app, each meeting&apos;s record
          until 60 days after the meeting, and a connection&apos;s problem log
          for 30 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creator research answers are kept for up to 24 months from the date
          you sent them, or until you ask us to delete them, whichever comes
          first. They are stored with our database provider (Upstash) on
          infrastructure used by our hosting provider (Vercel).
        </p>
        <p>
          Research outreach records (who we contacted, when, and any reply) are
          kept for up to 24 months from the last contact. If you ask us to
          stop, we keep only your name and contact detail on a do-not-contact
          list, so that we can respect your request.
