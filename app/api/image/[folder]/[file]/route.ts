 * Serves a product picture.
 *
 * A picture's name is fresh every time one is uploaded and nothing may be
 * written over it, so what is behind one address never changes and may be
 * cached everywhere for a year. That keeps the requests every visitor makes
 * out of this function almost entirely.
 *
 * The type it is served as comes from its own name, which the upload was
 * held to and whose first bytes were checked when it was attached; the
 * browser is told not to guess, and the picture may not run, frame or fetch.
