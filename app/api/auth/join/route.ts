 * Taking an invitation to a store's team (lib/team.ts).

 * Only a POST does it, for the reason the login link works that way: mail
 * filters open links, and a link a filter could spend would put its person
 * on the team by itself. The owner is told by email (lib/account-notice.ts).
 *
 * The invitation is for one address, and it is read before anything is
 * spent, so that:
 *
 *   - a browser logged in as a different address is refused, and nothing is
 *     spent: taking it would quietly swap whose studio that browser shows,
 *     which is how a link sent by somebody else could put a person to work
 *     in an account that is not theirs;
 *   - a browser already logged in as the invited address simply joins, in
 *     the session it has;
 *   - for an address that has no account yet, the tap proves the inbox is
 *     theirs, so it logs them in as that address with the store open;
 *   - for an address that already has an account (a store, another team, a
 *     passkey), the invitation only puts them on the team. It does not log
 *     in: a link that stays good for seven days must not be a seven-day key
 *     to an existing account, whose own login links last fifteen minutes.
 *     They log in the usual way and find the store in their studio.
