/**
 * Run every few minutes by Vercel: confirms purchases whose buyer never
 * reached the thanks page and sends the one reminder after an abandoned
 * checkout (lib/checkout-sweep.ts), starts scheduled emails when their time
 * comes, finishes long ones, sends each step of a sequence when it is due,
 * sends the reminders before booked calls (lib/call-reminders.ts), which
 * need this job's five-minute rhythm to arrive an hour before and not later,
 * then the same for the community's live events — reminders a day and an
 * hour before, the emails about a moved or cancelled event, and the
 * creator's phone fifteen minutes before (lib/community-event-mail.ts) —
 * finishes a community announcement's email (lib/community-mail.ts), and
 * sends the review requests that are due (lib/review-requests.ts).
 * Last, it reads each store's Stripe events for the creator's webhooks and
 * retries the webhook deliveries that are due (lib/webhooks.ts), then the
 * people waiting to be sent to a creator's own email platform
 * (lib/email-sync.ts) — which need
 * Redis and Stripe but not email, so they run even where sending is off, as
 * does writing down the sales that came through an affiliate's link (the
 * checkout pass). Right after the checkout pass, the one-click offers still
 * waiting on Stripe are settled (lib/upsell.ts), so an offer the bank
 * confirmed later gets its email and its affiliate credit without waiting
 * for the buyer to come back.
 *
 * The run has sixty seconds (maxDuration), shared out so that nothing
 * starves what comes after it. Each part starts no new piece of work after
 * its mark, and every piece is bounded, so a part ends at most one piece
 * past its mark:
 *
 *    0–12 s  the checkout pass
 *   –16 s    the one-click offers waiting on Stripe
 *   –30 s    the creators' emails: broadcasts, sequence steps, community
 *            announcements (the announcements check each member's access
 *            25 at a time, lib/mail.ts CHECKED_BATCH_SIZE, so one piece is
 *            a few seconds, not a hundred Stripe lookups)
 *   –40 s    call reminders: at least ten seconds even after a long send
 *   –43 s    live events' reminders and notices: at least three seconds,
 *            members checked 25 at a time as above
 *   –44 s    review requests, the least urgent: a day late is no harm
 *   –50 s    the webhook pass: Stripe's events read until 47; webhook
 *            retries started until 50, one try up to 8 s more (58); Google
 *            Meet and Zoom meetings (lib/call-meetings.ts) until 50, with
 *            every request to Google or Zoom given up by 55 whatever it is
 *            (withCutoff); email platforms started until 50, one try up to
 *            9 s more (59).
 *
 * The marks assume Redis, Stripe and the email service answer in a second or
 * two, as they do. Each of their requests is given up after its own limit
 * (lib/fetch-timeout.ts: Redis 5 s, Stripe 20 s, Resend 10 s), and the whole
 * run is under one cutoff at 57 s, so however slow one of them is that day,
 * no request is still waiting when Vercel stops the job at sixty; the
 * requests to other people's servers — webhook endpoints, email platforms,
 * Google and Zoom — carry hard timeouts of their own. Without email, live
 * events still get their phone notification, in the same place.
