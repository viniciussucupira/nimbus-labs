/**
 * Run on a schedule by Vercel, once a day, for the jobs that keep money
 * where it was agreed to be:
 *
 *   - gives every paid payment plan its end, so no buyer is ever charged
 *     more payments than they agreed to;
 *   - brings every store's "paid up" snapshot in line with its subscription
 *     at Stripe (lib/billing-sync.ts), so a store that stopped paying us
 *     stops selling, and one that paid while its way back got lost is
 *     written down;
 *   - tells each member whose renewal failed, once, with a link that pays it
 *     (lib/payment-recovery.ts), so a member whose card expired is not
 *     quietly cut off without ever being asked for a new one;
 *   - sends a former member who agreed to hear from the creator one
 *     come-back offer, days after their membership ended (lib/winback-send.ts);
 *   - adds the credit creators earned by inviting other creators
 *     (lib/creator-invite-credit.ts), once each payment's refund window has
 *     closed.
 *
 * And, with the time left, one piece of upkeep: every store written before
 * products had records of their own is moved to them (lib/catalog.ts). A
 * store is also moved the first time it is written, so this reaches the
 * ones nobody touches; a store already moved is passed over, and a walk the
 * clock cuts short carries on the next day.
 *
 * Safe to run more than once: each job only writes what is still wrong, and
 * one run at a time.
