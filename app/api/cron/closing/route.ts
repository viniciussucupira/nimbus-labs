/**
 * Run once a day by Vercel, after the job that brings every store's plan in
 * line with Stripe (app/api/cron/plans): looks at each store whose plan has
 * ended, and at what it still keeps (lib/plan-closing.ts).
 *
 * A store that keeps no more than a store with no plan may is left as it
 * is. One that keeps more is written to when its plan ends, a month before
 * the day and a week before it; on the day, and never sooner than a week
 * after the last of those, what it keeps is removed, once Stripe itself has
 * said that day that the store has no plan.
 *
 * A job of its own, with the whole minute to itself, because removing what
 * a large store keeps is many requests, and whatever is not finished is
 * finished the next day. One run at a time.
