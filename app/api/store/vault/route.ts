 * The door a sold file goes through from the studio's browser straight to

 *       many pieces it goes up in
 *   { action: "sign", pathname, numbers }            addresses for those pieces
 *   { action: "done", pathname, etags }              joins the pieces; answers

 *   { action: "abort", pathname }                    gives the upload up
 *
 * Asked for only what a signed-in creator may do, exactly as the door into
 * the host's own store is (app/api/store/file): the product, option or
 * lesson has to be one of this store's own, the file of a kind that may be
 * sold and no bigger than a file here may be, and the store under the
 * storage brake (lib/storage-quota.ts). Every later step is for a path in
 * this store's own folder, read from the session and never from the request.
 *
 * Answers `off`, not found, while that store is not set up. The studio then
 * uploads the way it always has.
