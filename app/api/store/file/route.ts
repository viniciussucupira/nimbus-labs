 * folder, and we sign a URL that accepts one upload of one kind of file up to
 * one size. Everything the signature allows is spelled out in it, so the door
 * cannot be widened by whoever holds it.
 *
 * This route is also where Vercel posts back when an upload finishes. That
 * message carries no session, and is trusted only because it is signed; the
 * signature is checked by the SDK against the store's public key. We do not
 * act on it — the browser tells us about its own upload, and that claim is
 * checked against the store before anything is saved — so it exists here only
 * to be answered politely rather than retried five times.
