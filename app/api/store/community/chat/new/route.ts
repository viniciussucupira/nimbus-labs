 * What came into a room after message N.
 *
 * Asked every few seconds by every open room (lib/chat-pace.ts), so it is
 * made to cost next to nothing. It reads no cookie and knows nobody: it is
 * opened by the pass a member's page is handed (lib/chat-pass.ts), reads
 * the room once, and says the CDN may give everybody who asks the same
 * question the same answer for a few seconds. Readers of one room are all
 * at the same message, so a hundred of them are one read of the database
 * every few seconds and not a hundred.
 *
 * Each message carries the name it was said under, so nothing else is read.
 * A pass that no longer fits is answered 403, and the page goes back to the
 * route above this one, which knows who it is, for a new one.
 *
 *   c   the community's id
 *   p   the pass
 *   s   the number of the last message the page has
 *   i   1 when the page is asking at the pace of a quiet room
