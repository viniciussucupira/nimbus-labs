/**
 * The studio's switcher, and the door out for a store.

 *                   remembers it as the one to open next time
 *   action=delete   deletes that store, when it is one of the owner's other
 *                   stores with nothing in it yet (lib/store.ts, deleteStore);
 *                   `confirm` must be its address, typed
 *
 * A plain form post either way, so the switcher works without JavaScript.
 * Which store is always the one the form names, checked against who is
 * signed in (lib/studio-route.ts): choosing needs any role on it, deleting
 * needs the owner.
