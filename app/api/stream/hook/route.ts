 * (lib/stream.ts).
 *
 * Not found until the service is set up with the key it signs these with.
 * An announcement is believed only when that signature is right, and even
 * then nothing in it is taken as fact: it names a video, and the service is
 * asked about that video. So one sent twice, or late, or out of order, does
 * what one sent once does. The five-minute job asks about every video that
 * is waiting in any case (app/api/cron/stream), so one that never arrives
 * costs a few minutes and nothing else.
