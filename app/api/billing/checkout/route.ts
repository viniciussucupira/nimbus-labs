/**
 * Sends the creator to Stripe to start paying us, monthly or yearly.
 *
 * Nothing new is written down here. The subscription only becomes real when
 * Stripe says it exists, on the way back, so a creator who opens the page and
 * closes it is left exactly as they were.
 *
 * Except one thing: a subscription Stripe already has for this store, in good
 * standing, that the store never heard about because the way back did not
 * arrive. That one is written down, and no second checkout is opened over it,
 * because two subscriptions for one store is two charges for one store.
 *
 * Each store of an account is its own subscription at its own plan; only
 * the owner reaches this (lib/team-roles.ts, "billing").
