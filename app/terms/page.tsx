      <p>
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the
        websites, products, and subscription services operated by Solrenning
        under the name Marktmorgen (“Marktmorgen,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). They
        cover this website and the Marktmorgen creator store (collectively,
        the “Services”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Solrenning is an independent software studio. We sell software to
        customers worldwide. By creating an account, purchasing a subscription,
        or otherwise using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do
        not agree, do not use the Services.
      </p>

      <LegalSection title="1. Eligibility and accounts">
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your
          jurisdiction if that is higher, to use the Services. By using the Services, you confirm
          that you meet this requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for providing accurate account information and for
          keeping your email inbox and any passkeys you add secure, since they
          are how you sign in. You are also responsible
          for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify us promptly at{" "}

          <strong className="text-black">Several stores and a team.</strong>{" "}
          One account may run up to five stores. Each store is a subscription
          of its own; the free trial applies to an account&apos;s first store
          only. The owner of a store may invite up to five people to its team.
          Team members sign in with their own email address and act on the
          owner&apos;s behalf, within the role the owner gives them: what they
          do in the studio is done for the owner, and the owner remains
          responsible for the store and for what the team does in it under
          these Terms. Only the owner pays for the store, connects its Stripe
          account, manages its team and deletes it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or that
          we reasonably believe pose a risk to the Services, other users, or
          our operations.

      <LegalSection title="2. The Services">
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">The Marktmorgen creator store.</strong> A
          hosted store page where a creator sells digital files, courses,
          memberships and calls, and can run a community for their buyers and
          an affiliate program. The buyer pays into the creator&apos;s own connected Stripe
          account, and the file is delivered as soon as the payment clears.
          Marktmorgen takes 0% of a creator&apos;s sales; what we charge a
          creator is a subscription for the store itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creator stores are open. Taking a store address, building the page and
          connecting a Stripe account are free. Taking a card on that page
          requires a paid subscription, which, on an account&apos;s first
          store, begins with a free trial of 14 days, and which renews every month or every year, whichever you chose,
          at the price shown on the home page until it is canceled. The price
          and the payment provider are shown before any card is asked for, and
          these Terms apply to that subscription. We email you at least seven
          days before the first charge after the trial, and, on a yearly
          subscription, between 15 and 45 days before each renewal, with the
          date, the amount and how to cancel.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may update, improve, or discontinue features. When practical, we
          will provide reasonable notice of material changes. Except for a
          creator store used as described in section 3, the Services are
          provided for your personal or internal business use. You may not
          resell, sublicense, or offer the Services to third parties as your
          own product without our prior written permission.

      <LegalSection title="3. Selling through a Marktmorgen store">
        <p>
          This section applies if you use Marktmorgen to sell to your own buyers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">You are the seller.</strong> Each sale
          made through your store is a contract between you and your buyer.
          Marktmorgen is not a party to it, is not the merchant of record for
          it, and does not sell your products to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">The money is never ours.</strong>{" "}
          Payments are made into your own Stripe account through Stripe direct
          charges. We never hold, route, or take a cut of your sales revenue.
          Payouts follow the schedule and settings of your own Stripe account,
          and your relationship with Stripe is governed by your agreement with
          Stripe, not by these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">What you are responsible for.</strong>{" "}
          The product you sell and its description and price; having the rights
          to everything you upload and sell; answering your own buyers;
          refunds, disputes, and chargebacks on your own sales; and any tax you
          owe on your sales, including sales tax, VAT, or GST where it applies
          to you. If you run an affiliate program, paying your affiliates what
          you agreed is yours too: we keep the record, and we never hold or
          pay out that money. If you run a community, what is posted in it is
          yours to moderate, and the rules in section 4 apply to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Reviews.</strong> Reviews on your
          store come only from buyers whose payment your Stripe account
          confirms. You may answer a review and hide one. You may not offer
          anything in return for a review, or present as a review anything a
          buyer did not write. A hidden review still counts
          in your average, and your page says how many are hidden.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">Services you choose to connect.</strong>{" "}
          If you connect an email platform (Mailchimp, Kit, beehiiv or
          MailerLite), your Google Calendar or, once it is offered, your Zoom
          account, or choose Jitsi Meet rooms or your own meeting link for
          your calls and live events, that is your choice. Those services are run by third parties under their own
          terms and privacy policies, your account with them is yours, and we
          are not responsible for what they do or for their availability.
          Send to an email platform only people who agreed to hear from you;
          the Services send only those who did. A meeting made on your Google
          or Zoom account is yours: it stays there if you disconnect, and
          what that service does with it is between you and them.

            Bringing a store from another platform.
          </strong>{" "}
          When you import contacts, you confirm, and are responsible for it
          being true, that every person in the file agreed to receive your
          emails, and that you may lawfully give us their details. When you
          import past buyers, you confirm that each person bought what the
          file says from you, that you have the right to give it to them
          here, and, if you ask us to email them, that you may tell them so.
          We check the file&apos;s format, not the truth of it, and we may
          switch off imports or email for a store that misuses them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="text-black">What you may not sell.</strong>{" "}
          Anything unlawful; anything that infringes someone else&apos;s rights;
          sexual content; anything that misleads your buyer about what they are
          paying for; and anything that falls under the list of restricted
          businesses published by Stripe, since your payments run through
          Stripe.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may remove a product or suspend a store that breaks this section.
          Doing so does not affect the money already in your own Stripe
          account.

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="4. Acceptable use">
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            use the Services for unlawful, harmful, fraudulent, or abusive
            purposes;
          </li>
          <li>
            attempt to reverse engineer, disrupt, overload, or interfere with
            the Services;

          <li>

          <li>
            circumvent usage limits, payment requirements, or security
            measures; or

          <li>
            upload or sell anything you do not have the right to distribute.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you email your list through the Services, you also agree to write
          only to people who agreed to hear from you; never to import an
          address that was bought, rented, borrowed or collected without that
          agreement; to give a true postal address where you can be reached,
          which we print at the bottom of each email; to write subject lines that
          are not misleading; and to follow the laws on commercial email that
          apply to you and to your readers, including the CAN-SPAM Act in the
          United States. Every email carries an unsubscribe link that we honor
          permanently, and you may not ask anyone to do more than click it. An
          address that cannot be delivered to, or whose owner reports an email
          as spam, is taken off your list automatically and is not written to
          again. {healthRuleWords()}
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use Outreach to write to a business, you are the sender of
          that email: it leaves from your own mailbox, under your own name. You
          agree to send it only to the business address the studio found for
          it, with the closing lines the studio adds left as they are; to send
          what you have read and stand behind, with nothing in it that is
          untrue; never to use it to write to a private person, or to a list;
          to stop writing to a business the moment it asks, and to record it
          in your studio; and to follow your mail provider&apos;s rules and the
          laws on commercial email that apply to you and to the business you
          write to. The studio refuses what it can tell is not allowed, but it
          is not legal advice, and what you send is yours to answer for.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may investigate suspected violations and take action, including
          pausing a send, switching off email for a store, or suspending or
          terminating your account.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="fair-use" title="5. What the subscription covers">
        <p>
          The published limits are the ones in your studio and on our pricing
          page: the number of products a store may list, the size of a single
          file, how many emails a month a plan may send,{" "}
          {bytesWords(DELIVERY_ALLOWANCE_BYTES)} of downloads a month per
          store, and {VIDEO_HOURS_INCLUDED} hours of lesson video watched a
          month per store. You can see every one of them while you use the
          Services.
          None of them is hidden in this document and then discovered by being
          enforced against you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not stop a download because a store has passed that figure.
          Somebody paid you for that file, and cutting your buyer off to
          protect our costs would be taking money for a sale and then not
          completing it. A paid download is never refused, at any number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing is charged for downloads, inside that figure or past it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lesson video is the one thing here that is billed by use. It is
          measured by the time your students spend watching your lesson
          videos, as the video player counts it, added up across your store
          for each calendar month and read about once an hour. Your plan
          covers {VIDEO_HOURS_INCLUDED} hours a month. Past that, video is
          charged rather than limited: {centsWords(VIDEO_CENTS_PER_HOUR_OVER)}{" "}
          for each hour watched above {VIDEO_HOURS_INCLUDED} in a calendar
          month, counted to the second and rounded down to the cent, added to
          your next subscription invoice on the card you already pay with. On
          a plan paid by the year, those lines are invoiced monthly. A student
          is never cut off because a store has passed its hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are emailed automatically the first time a month&apos;s
          watching passes the hours your plan covers, with your own figure in
          it, and the same figure is in your studio at any time. A month in
          which you stay inside them costs nothing beyond your plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          A store with no paid plan has nothing a charge can be added to, so
          its lesson videos are paused past its hours until the plan is paid
          or the month turns: {VIDEO_HOURS_INCLUDED} hours a month in the
          free trial, and {SETUP_VIDEO_HOURS} hours a month before a plan is
          started and after one has ended. Nothing is charged for those
          hours, and everything else in a course stays open.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we ask in return is that the Services are used to sell your own
          work to your own audience, and not as general file hosting, a
          content delivery network, a backup service, or a way to distribute
          very large files at a scale the subscription does not cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your store passes the download allowance in a month, our system
          emails you the next morning with your own figure in it. That notice
          is automatic: it does not wait for anybody here to notice, and it
          reaches you whether or not we are looking. Your studio shows the
          same number at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two things happen on their own, and neither touches a buyer. Free
          copies — files given away rather than bought — pause for the rest
          of the month once a store has sent out{" "}
          {bytesWords(FREE_PAUSE_ABOVE_BYTES)} in that month, and resume when
          the month turns; anything anyone has bought is unaffected. And new
          uploads stop once a store holds as much as it may:{" "}
          {storageWords(STORAGE_BRAKE_BYTES)} on a paid plan, which is far
          more than a storefront needs,{" "}
          {storageWords(TRIAL_STORAGE_BYTES)} in a plan&apos;s free trial, and{" "}
          {storageWords(SETUP_STORAGE_BYTES)} for a store with no plan, before
          one is started or after one has ended. That asks you to remove
          something before adding more and changes nothing about what is
          already there or already sold; a store that holds more than its
          figure when its plan ends keeps what it holds and cannot add to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond those, we may limit or suspend a store only if use far above
          the published allowances continues after that notice has been sent
          and you have had a reasonable time to answer, or where the use is
          plainly abusive or unlawful. We will not do it silently, and never
          in the middle of delivering something a buyer has already paid for.

      <LegalSection title="6. Subscriptions and payment">
        <p>
          A creator store subscription is charged at the price shown at
          checkout, and these Terms apply to it. The sales a
          creator makes are not ours: they run through that creator&apos;s own
          Stripe account, as described in section 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payment is processed by Stripe, our payment provider. We do not
          store full payment card numbers. Prices are in United States dollars
          unless otherwise stated. You are responsible for any applicable
          taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may change subscription prices. If we do, we will provide notice
          before the new price applies to a future billing period. The new
          price will not apply to a period you have already paid for.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three plans. Marktmorgen, at $29 a month or $300 a year,
          includes everything you need to sell. Marktmorgen Pro, at $99 a month or $948
          a year, adds email to your list{domains ? " and your store on a domain you own" : ""},
          with up to {PRO_MONTHLY_EMAILS.toLocaleString("en-US")} emails a month,
          counted together for one-off emails, sequences, community
          announcements and the emails that ask buyers for a review; during
          the free
          trial a store may send up to {TRIAL_MONTHLY_EMAILS.toLocaleString("en-US")} emails a month, and the full
          number opens with the first payment. Emails not sent in a month do
          not carry over, and emails beyond a month&apos;s allowance wait for
          the next month. Marktmorgen Scale, at $249 a month or $2,388 a year,
          is Marktmorgen Pro with up to{" "}
          {SCALE_MONTHLY_EMAILS.toLocaleString("en-US")} emails a month, counted

          You may switch between monthly and yearly billing, and between the
          plans, from your studio.
          A switch that costs more is charged when you make it, less the unused
          part of the period you already paid for. A switch that costs less
          leaves the unused part as credit on your account, applied to your
          next charges until it is used up. Credit is not paid out in cash,
          except where a refund applies under our Refund Policy.

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="7. Creator invites" id="invites">
        <p>
          Your studio gives you a link to invite other creators. When someone
          accepts your invite and then makes the first store of a new
          account, that store counts as invited by you. It does not count if
          the account belongs to you, if it had paid us before it was invited,
          or if another invite was accepted for it first.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every payment an invited account makes to us for its stores,
          we add {INVITE_SHARE_PERCENT}% of the amount actually paid, less any
          refund or credit given back on it, as credit on your account,{" "}
          {INVITE_HOLD_DAYS} days after the payment. After its first payment,
          the invited account gets {formatMoney(INVITE_BONUS_CENTS, "usd")} of
          credit on its own account, at the same time. Credit is applied by
          our payment provider to your next charges until it is used up. It is
          not paid out in cash, cannot be transferred, and is not refunded if
          you cancel.

      <LegalSection title="8. Cancellation">
        <p>
          You may cancel your subscription at any time, for any reason. After
          you cancel, you will not be charged for future billing periods. You
          will retain access until the end of the period you have already paid
          for, unless a refund applies under our Refund Policy.

            Refund Policy
          </Link>
          . In summary, every charge is refunded in full on request within
          {REFUND_DAYS} days of that charge, for any reason or none.
        </p>
        <p>
          A refund on something you bought from a creator&apos;s store is a
          matter between you and that creator, who received your money in their
          own Stripe account and sets their own refund terms.

      <LegalSection title="10. Intellectual property">
        <p>
          Marktmorgen and its licensors own all rights in the Services,
          including the software, branding, design, and documentation. These
          Terms do not grant you any right to use our name, logos, or
          trademarks except as needed to identify the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of what you submit to the Services (“User
          Content”) — the files, images, text and descriptions you upload to
          your store. You grant Marktmorgen a limited license to host, store
          and deliver User Content solely to provide the Services: to show your
          store page to the people you send there, and to hand a file to the
          buyer who paid you for it. We do not use your files or your store&apos;s
          text to train anything, and we do not sell or license them to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          That license lasts as long as you keep the content on Marktmorgen. When you
          remove a product or close your store, it ends for the content removed.

      <LegalSection title="11. Disclaimer of warranties">
        <p>
          THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM
          EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
          IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
          AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not warrant that the Services will be
          uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.

      <LegalSection title="12. Limitation of liability">
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, MARKTMORGEN AND
          ITS OWNERS, OFFICERS, AND CONTRACTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
          INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR
          ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE
          SERVICES.
        </p>
        <p>
          OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE
          SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US IN THE THREE (3)
          MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM AROSE, OR US$50, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. Money
          a buyer paid into a creator&apos;s own Stripe account was never paid
          to us and is not part of that amount.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations. In those cases,
          our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
          Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be limited under
          applicable mandatory law, including liability for fraud or willful
          misconduct.

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="13. Indemnification">
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold Marktmorgen harmless from claims
          arising out of your User Content, the products you sell through a
          Marktmorgen store, your use of the Services, or your violation of these
          Terms or applicable law.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="14. Termination">
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms, if
          required by law, or if we discontinue the Services. Upon termination,
          your right to use the Services ends. Sections that by their nature
          should survive — including intellectual property, disclaimers,
          limitation of liability, and governing law — will survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we suspend or close a store, we email its owner the reason
          and give them a chance to answer, unless the law, or an urgent risk
          to buyers, other users or the Services, requires us to act at once;
          in that case we email the reason as soon as we can. If we discontinue
          the Services, we give at least 30 days&apos; notice by email.

      <LegalSection title="15. Changes to these Terms">
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. The &ldquo;Last
          updated&rdquo; date at the top of this page will change when we do. Material changes
          will be posted on this page. Continued use of the Services after
          changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="16. Governing law">
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of the Federative Republic of
          Brazil, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Courts located in
          Brazil will have exclusive jurisdiction, except that you may have
          additional mandatory consumer rights in your country of residence.
