      <p>
        Nimbus Labs is a link-in-bio store where creators sell digital
        products, courses, memberships and paid video calls. The Zoom app lets
        a creator have a Zoom meeting made on their own Zoom account for each
        call booked in their store, and for their community&apos;s live events,
        without copying and pasting links.
      </p>
      <p>
        Connecting Zoom opens to every store once Zoom approves our Marketplace
        listing. Until then, your studio does not show the Zoom option.

      <LegalSection title="Adding the app" id="add">
        <p>You need a Nimbus Labs store and a Zoom account. Only the store&apos;s owner or an Admin can connect it.</p>

            gets its own scheduled meeting on your Zoom account; a group call or a session on dates gets one meeting per time,

      <LegalSection title="What the app can see and do" id="data">
        <p>
          Nimbus Labs asks Zoom to create, read, update and delete meetings on your account, and to see your account&apos;s
          name and email address, to show which account is connected. It only ever changes or deletes meetings it created.
          It does not read your other meetings, recordings, chats or participant lists. We keep the IDs and join links of
          the meetings we made, your Zoom user ID, name and email address, and the access and refresh tokens, which are encrypted. More in our{" "}

            <strong className="text-black">From your studio.</strong> Open Video calls and press{" "}
            <strong className="text-black">Disconnect</strong> under Zoom. We hand the token back to Zoom, which ends access, and
            delete what we kept about the connection.

            its tokens, and the store&apos;s owner is emailed.

        </ul>
        <p>
          Either way, meetings already made stay on your Zoom account and keep working. New bookings use your own link, or a
