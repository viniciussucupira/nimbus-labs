Stripe takes your card when the trial starts and first charges it when the 14 days end; we email you a week before that charge, and if you cancel before it — one click in your studio — it is never charged.

If the bank wants the buyer to confirm, they confirm it, and nothing is handed over until the payment is through.",

The rest are charged to the same card on your own Stripe account, and the plan is given its end as soon as the first payment is through \u2014 and checked again every day for anyone who paid and closed the page \u2014 so no buyer is ever charged one payment more than they agreed to.
