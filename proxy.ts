 * here. On a creator's domain, the root is their store page, the store's own
 * pages keep their short paths (/thanks, /course/…, /p/<product>, /community,
 * /affiliates, /renew/<product>, /certificate/<id>, /review), and
 * anything that belongs to the site itself — signing in, the studio, the help
 * pages — is sent to marktmorgen.com, where the session lives.
 *
 * The store page is told which domain it was reached on, so it can send a
 * visitor back to marktmorgen.com if the store is no longer on Pro.
 *
 * Two more jobs happen here because this runs before everything else: every
 * page rendered for a visit gets its Content-Security-Policy with a fresh
 * nonce (lib/csp.ts), and every request to the API that changes something is
 * refused when it comes from another site or carries a body too large to
 * read (guardApi, below).
