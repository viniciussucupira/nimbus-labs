  /**
   * Headers every response carries, marketing pages included.
   *
   * Set here rather than in proxy.ts on purpose: a page Next has prerendered
   * is served straight from Vercel's edge cache without the proxy running, so
   * headers added there reach the studio and the store pages and quietly miss
   * the home page. This list reaches all of them.
   *
   * The Content-Security-Policy here is the one for pages built ahead of
   * time (lib/csp.ts explains both). The pages rendered for each visit — the
   * stores, the studio — are given a stricter one with a fresh nonce by
   * proxy.ts, which replaces this one on those responses. Its frame-ancestors
   * is the rule that matters most: without it anyone can put the studio
   * inside an invisible frame on their own site and collect a signed-in
   * creator's clicks on buttons they never meant to press. 'self' is used
   * rather than 'none' so that a page of ours may still show another of
   * ours, as the home page once showed the demo store; X-Frame-Options says
   * the same to browsers that predate the policy.
   *
   * Strict-Transport-Security deliberately has no includeSubDomains: these
   * pages are also served on creators' own domains, and on theirs it would
   * force https on every other subdomain they run, which is not ours to
   * decide.
   *
   * Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy keeps a page opened from ours (or ours opened
   * from elsewhere) from holding a handle on the other window. Stripe is
   * reached by a redirect, never a popup, so nothing needs that handle.
